#### 感覺會迷惑認知

66:55  
:older_woman: I think we were going to talk a little bit about, um,  
not like nocturnal species, won't we yeah?  
:older_woman: 我想我們先要講一下夜行性物種的事，對不對？

67:03
:bearded_person: Yeah maybe we'll jump to there first.
:bearded_person: 是的，也許我們會先跳到那裡。

67:05
Because, I think that is one of those, you know, partly, as you're saying, you know...
因為，我想那是其中之一部分，你知道，正如你所說的，你知道...

67:07
Talking about how our pupils dilate and contract, makes it,
說到我們的瞳孔如何擴張收縮，使它，

67:11
it makes you realize, how much of our perception confuses us, and it makes it.
讓你意識到，我們有多少的感知在迷惑我們，並且它做到了。

67:16  
So, it's constantly a moving target.  
它是不間斷的、一個移動中的目標。

67:18  
Like just our own eyes looking at our enclosures,  
就像我們自己的眼睛看著我們的圍欄，

67:19  
We don't even know what we're looking at half the time.  
我們甚至不知道大半時間我們在看什麼，

67:22  
Because your brain does so much, you know, mapping and so much filling in the gaps.
因為你的大腦做了很多映射和填補空白。

67:27
So we really can't go off of our own eyesight.
所以我們真的不能離開自己的視線。

#### 夜行性動物需要光來當一個夜行性動物

67:28
And I think nocturnal species are interesting,
我覺得夜行動物很有趣，

67:31
Because they typically, you know,
因為他們通常，你知道，

67:33
it's getting better now,
現在情況有比較好，

67:35
but the general recommendation was they don't need light,
但尋常的建議是他們不需要光，

67:37
because they are nocturnal.
因為他們是夜間活動.

67:38
And all the way to the point  
where many nocturnal species are kept in tubs that are absent of light,
直到這個地步：許多夜間活動的物種都被關沒有光線的容器裡，

67:43
like opaque tubs.
例如不透明的桶子。

67:46
Obviously, they must still have some of those hormones being driven off of the solar, the sun coming up and down, so...
很明顯，他們肯定仍然有一些荷爾蒙被太陽驅動，而太陽會升起落下，所以...

67:56
What are some of these recommendations for for nocturnal species?
對於夜間活動的物種的建議有哪些？

68:00
:older_woman: It's one of those interesting things, isn't it?
:older_woman: 這也是有趣的事情之一，不是嗎？

68:04
Because if an animal was nocturnal,
因為如果一個動物是夜行的，

68:06
it's still in the wild has to know
牠在野外仍然需要知道

68:09
when it's day and when it's night, for it to be nocturnal.
何時是白天，何時是夜晚，因為要當一個 "夜間動物"。

68:10
If you see what I mean.
如果你明白我的意思。

68:12
If it was dark all the time, it would never know when it was day when it was night.
如果一直是黑暗的，牠永遠不會知道什麼時候是白天、什麼時候是晚上。

68:17
And nocturnal activities cued by sunset and sunrise.
而夜間活動是根據日落和日出。

#### 退黑激素

68:21
So in the case of nocturnally active creatures,
所以對於夜間活動的生物，

68:24
the fact, that the light signals to the brain to block the melatonin synthesis
事實上，光向大腦發出信號，阻斷了褪黑激素合成，

68:31
whereas in day active ones, that blocking makes them wake up.
而在白天活動的動物，這種阻斷會使牠們醒來。

68:37
The extraordinary thing is,
不同尋常的是，

68:38
that the biochemistry is changed with the non-internally active ones in that,
生物化學與非內部活性物質發生變化，

68:40
when you block the melatonin synthesis,
當你阻斷褪黑激素合成，

68:44
it sends them to sleep,
這讓牠們 (夜行性動物) 入睡。

68:46
Um and we were looking at...
嗯，我們正在研究...

68:47
:bearded_person: Melatonin production is the exact same for both, it spikes in the evening,
:bearded_person: 這兩者的褪黑激素產量完全相同，在晚上激增，

68:51
but for nocturnal animals, it makes them have energy,
但對於夜行動物，它讓他們有能量，

68:53
and for us, it makes us fall asleep.
而對我們來說，它讓我們想睡。

68:56
:older_woman: Yes yes, that's right, it is.
:older_woman: 是的 是的，沒錯，就是這樣。

68:58  
It's extraordinary, it's it's like the bright light,  
這很了不起，明亮的光，

69:00  
makes it, makes the, um, blocks the meditation.  
阻斷了褪黑激素。

69:02  
And when the melatonin starts to drop,  
the nocturnal animals go to sleep, because it's daytime.  
當褪黑激素開始下降時，夜行動物去睡覺，因為是白天。

69:09  
And we looked at that a lot.  
When I was working with primates, when I was working with the zoos.  
我們見證到很多。當我在動物園工作、和靈長類動物一起時。

69:14  
Because that's they've done quite a lot of work on that.  
因為他們在這方面做了很多工作。

69:18
But I mean, going back to the thing about it, being dark all the time.
但我意思是，回到 "一直都是黑暗" 的事。

69:20  
There isn't anywhere on the surface of the earth,  
apart from really deep caves where daylight doesn't penetrate.  
地球表面，除了非常深的洞穴外，沒有任何地方日光無法到達。

69:27  
Because even in a a cave, or a tunnel,  
you know you can see the light from the outside,  
因為即使在洞穴或隧道裡，你也可以看到外面的光。

69:32
You can see the entrance of the tunnel,
你可以看到隧道的入口，

69:34
you can see whether the sun's there, or it isn't there.
你可以看到太陽是在那裡，或不在。

69:39
And the sun always comes and goes in predictable patterns.
太陽總是以可預測的方式來去。

69:43
There's only one place which is really common for it.
Not to do that!
只有一種地方不是這樣，而且很尋常。不要這樣做!

69:45
And that's in a windowless room.
那就是一個沒有窗戶的房間。

69:50
Or in an opaque rub on a shelf...
As you as you pointed out.
或不透明容器中，在一個架子上...
正如你指出的。

#### 夜行性動物活動時間

69:54
And when nocturnal species are studied in the wild,
當在野外研究夜間活動的物種時，

69:58
we we find that most of them aren't strictly nocturnal.
我們發現，它們中的大多數並不是嚴格意義上的夜間活動。

70:00
Many of them are ephemeral,
they're active at any time of the day.
大多數是短暫活躍的，牠們在一天中任何時候都很活躍。

70:06
`Francis Coskeri?` has a huge collection of photos of nocturnal geckos from all over the world.
弗朗西斯·科斯凱里 (`Francis Coskeri?`) 收集了大量夜行壁虎的照片，來自世界各地。

70:11
That he's photographed out in daylight, and even in full sunlight.
這些照片都是他在白天拍攝的，甚至是充足的陽光下。

70:14
And I've got a few of his pictures too, and some of my own.
我也有一些他的照片，還有一些我自己的。

70:20
But the main activity period is often at dusk, or in the early part of the night.
但是主要的活動時間往往是在黃昏，或者剛入夜時。

70:24
Because that's when the environment is still warm enough for them to be optimally active.
因為那時環境仍然足夠溫暖，使它們處於最佳活動狀態。

70:29
So their rhythms synchronize with both light and temperature,
changing over the course of the day.
所以它們的節奏與光和溫度同步，在一天中不斷變化。

70:35
So the study we talked about the tokay gecko altered its body temperature,
所以我們談到大壁虎改變體溫的研究，

70:38
because it could sense the bright light was no longer warming the area below it.
因為牠可以感覺到亮光不再溫暖照到的區域。

70:43
Now that's really interesting that nocturnal animal is modulating according to the light sees during the day.
這真的很有趣，夜行動物是根據牠們白天看到的光進行調節的。

#### 扭曲的生理節律

70:54
So yeah, I can't see any reason,
why you would keep an animal without, without at least some exposure to the daylight.
所以是的，我找不到任何理由，讓你在沒有光的情況飼養一隻動物，至少有一些暴露在白天。

70:59
:bearded_person: Well, I sort of think...
:bearded_person: 好吧，我有點想...
:older_woman: Yeah.
:older_woman: 是的。

71:03
:bearded_person: It's you know, we are a diurnal species,
:bearded_person: 你知道的，我們是晝夜活動的物種，

71:05
so that it would be making the same claim would be saying,
所以可以提出同樣的主張，

71:06
Well, we never need darkness.
例如，我們從不需要黑暗。

71:08
Because we are active during the light,
因為我們在亮光中活躍，

71:10
So, we'll just leave the lights on,
所以，我們就讓燈亮著，

71:11
and imagine how crazy you'd go after three days of that.
想像一下，那樣子三天后你會變得多麼瘋狂。

:older_woman: Yeah that's right, and actually, it would be very damaging, yes, it would.
:older_woman: 是的，沒錯，實際上，這將是非常具有破壞性的，真的。

71:19
But it's amazing how resilient reptiles are,
但令人驚訝的是爬行動物的韌性，

71:21
I mean they can live in in the pitch dark,
我是說他們可以住在在一片漆黑中，

71:23
because people have done so.
因為人們已經這樣做了。

71:25
But their body rhythms have got to be skewed.
但他們的身體節奏一定是扭曲的。

71:29
They're skewed, by doing that.
他們被扭曲了，因為人們這樣對待。

#### 光只是視覺提示?

71:32
:bearded_person: So then you know, theoretically just say you have an animal,
:bearded_person: 你知道，理論上只要說你有一隻動物，

71:33
that spends most of its time in a hide.
牠大部分時間都隱藏著。

71:35
And it would see the mouth of the hide as the light, and that's going to give its cue.
它會將隱藏處的出口視為光，而那成為牠的提示。

71:36
You could see a keeper saying...
你可以看到一個飼養人說...

71:40
"Well, why don't I just provide like a simple light bulb,
「喔，為何我不能就提供一個簡單的燈泡，

71:42
that's going to signify the day night".
那樣直接代表白天黑夜」。

71:44
And "Why do I need to go to the lengths of going UV full spectrum and infrared?
還有 「為什麼我需要深入了解紫外線、全光譜和紅外線？

71:48
if it's only going to be using it as a visual cue, if that makes sense".
如果這只是將它用作視覺提示，如果是這道理」。

:older_woman: Well, it isn't really, is it?
喔，這不是真的吧，是嗎？

71:56
The UV is in the light, it's very diluted of course.
If the light's very dim.
紫外線在光線中，當然是非常稀釋的。
如果光線很暗。

72:03
But the proportion of it will be exactly the same.
但比例會是一樣。

72:05
Because it's not filtered out by the cave.
因為洞穴不會去過濾它。

72:08
The light that's coming into the cave has the same spectrum, as full sunlight.
進入洞穴的光線具有與完全陽光相同的光譜。

72:12
It's just a lot a lot less of it.
只是量少了很多。

72:15
So you're still going to get a lot of UVB.
所以你仍然受到很多的紫外線影響。

72:16
And a lot of animals sleep in crevices, in bark and in corners under foliage.
許多動物睡在樹皮的縫隙和樹葉下的角落裡，

72:23
they're in daylight all day.
他們在日光下整天。

72:26
And and quite a few, some of the geckos,
還有不少，一些壁虎。

72:28
For example, they sleep on the trunk of the tree,
例如，他們睡在樹幹上，

72:30  
which gets full light for daylight.
它在白天獲得充足的日光。

72:32
It may not get actual sunlight because it would be too hot.
它可能不會得到真正的陽光，因為會太熱。

72:34
But, um like I think,
但是，嗯，就像我認為的，

72:36
they're getting UV, they're getting quite high levels of UV sometimes, during the day.
他們會受到紫外線影響，在白天有時會得到相當高水平的紫外線。

#### 體溫調節

:bearded_person: And so what about this we were talking earlier, about the thermoconformer?
那麼我們之前談論的這個呢，關於 "體溫順應者"？

72:45
Where they are not necessarily using the bright light as a signal for where to bask.
牠們不一定用強光作為 "在哪裡曬太陽" 的信號。

72:51
As far as your concern is, for setting up lighting would be the exact same, and you'll let them...
就你所擔憂的是，光照的設定會完全相同，你會讓他們...

72:54
Maybe you have more cage decor to dim out the light or...
也許用更多環境設計來使燈光暗，或者...

72:56
What do you, what are your thoughts there?
你有什麼想法呢？
:older_woman: Yeah.
:older_woman: 是的。

73:00
Just I think that's a good one actually.
我認為那是一個很好的方法，其實。

73:02
Um, off the top of my head, I think I just try and replicate dappled sunlight.
嗯，一時想到的，我想我只是嘗試複製斑駁的陽光。

73:08
Because underneath trees, you always get that mosaic of of bright and dark,
因為在樹下，你總能看到明暗交錯的馬賽克，

73:12
um it's sometimes, very very small circles of dark and light all into intertwining.
嗯，有時，非常非常小的黑暗和光明圈交織在一起。

73:18
and I would imagine the thermoconformer can see that as well as anyone else.
我想 "體溫順應者" 也能看到這一點跟其他動物一樣，

73:23
and then we'll move into an area which is the right temperature,
然後我們會移動到溫度合適的區域，

73:28
and move around, most of the thermalconformers aren't `stripped ammo conformers?` actually.
並四處走動，實際上，大多數熱順應動物不是`被剝離 ammo conformers?` 的。

73:32
They tend to shift they go up and down trees,
他們傾向於在樹上上下移動，

73:37
and move around the bark,
在樹皮周圍移動，

73:39
um, to to maintain the temperature they want,
嗯，保持他們想要的溫度，

73:41
um, so they are actually `thermal regulating?`,
嗯，所以它們實際上是會`調節體溫?`，

73:44
but not in the full basking sense.
但意義上不完全是曬太陽。

#### ing <!--  -->

73:47
:bearded_person: Right, well and I think a story that I've told in the podcast before is,
對，好吧，我想起一個我以前在播客中講過的故事，

73:49
when I created that sort of dappling effect with my jungle carpet python,
當我在我的叢林地毯蟒蛇的環境弄出那種斑駁的效果時，

73:53
that was the first time I'd seen his natural coloration and his his pattern come into play as far as camouflage goes,
那是我第一次看到牠的自然色彩和圖案發揮偽裝的作用。

74:01
because it was this sort of dappling of the sun, slants of sun, coming through the enclosure,
因為是傾斜陽光穿過圍欄的這種斑駁，

74:04
and then all of a sudden his, you know, contrast of dark black bars and yellow bars it made perfect sense,
然後突然間他的，你知道的，深黑色條和黃色條的對比都有意義了，

74:11
he became very difficult to see in the back of the enclosure,
他變得很難在圍欄的後面看到，

74:13
where before, it was like very obvious like there's a yellow and black snake he can't hide anywhere.
以前，很明顯，好像有一條黃黑相間的蛇，哪裡都藏不住。

74:18
but, so, the animals are off evolving in those environments,
但是，因此，動物在這些(錯誤的)環境中無法進化，

74:21
and they're using that the speckled sun to to be part of their camouflage as well.
他們還利用斑點太陽作為偽裝的一部分。
:older_woman: yeah makes perfect sense, doesn't it.
:older_woman: 是的，完全有道理，不是嗎。

74:28
they've evolved to use the environment that they normally live in.
它們已經進化到可以使用它們通常生活的環境。
:bearded_person: yeah.
:bearded_person: 是。
