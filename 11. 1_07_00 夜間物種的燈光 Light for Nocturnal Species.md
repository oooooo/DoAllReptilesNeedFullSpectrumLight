:older_woman: I think we were going to talk a little bit about, um, 
not like nocturnal species, won't we yeah?
:older_woman: 我想我們要談談，不同於夜行性物種，不是嗎？

67:03
:bearded_person: yeah maybe we'll jump to there first
:bearded_person: 是的，也許我們會先跳到那裡，

67:05
because, I think that is one of those, you know, partly as you're saying, you know, 
因為，我想那是其中之一，你知道，正如你所說的，你知道，

67:07
talking about how our pupils dilate and contract, makes it, 
談到我們的瞳孔如何擴張收縮，

67:11
it makes you realize, how much of our perception confuses us, and it makes it.
讓它讓你意識到，我們有多少的感知正在迷惑我們，並且它做到了。

67:16
so it's constantly a moving target,
它始終是一個移動的目標，

67:18
like just our own eyes looking at our enclosures,
就像我們自己的眼睛看著我們的圍欄，

67:19
we don't even know what we're looking at half the time.
我們有一半時間甚至不知道我們在看什麼，

67:22
because your brain does so much, you know, mapping and so much filling in the gaps.
因為你的大腦做了很多映射和填補空白。

67:27
so we really can't go off of our own eyesight.
所以我們真的不能離開自己的視線。

67:28
and I think nocturnal species are interesting,
我覺得夜行動物很有趣，

67:31
because they typically, you know,
很有趣，因為他們

67:33
it's getting better now,
通常你知道情況會好轉

67:35
but the general recommendation was, they don't need light,
現在，但一般建議是

67:37
because they are nocturnal, 
他們不需要光，因為他們是夜間活動

67:38
and all the way to the point where many nocturnal species are kept in in tubs,
一直到許多夜間活動的物種都被關在浴缸裡，

67:43
that are absent of light like opaque tubs.
像不透明的浴缸一樣沒有光線。

67:46
yeah, so, what, what.
obviously, they must still have some of those hormones being driven off of the solar, the sun coming up and down, so,
很明顯，他們肯定仍然有一些荷爾蒙被太陽驅動，太陽升落，所以，
 
67:56
what are some of these recommendations for for nocturnal species?
對於夜間活動的物種，這些建議有哪些？

68:00
:older_woman: it's it's one of those interesting things, isn't it?
:older_woman: 這也是有趣的事情之一，不是嗎？

68:04
because if an animal was nocturnal,
因為如果動物是夜間活動的，

68:06
it's still in the wild has to know, 
祂在野外仍然必須知道，

68:09
when it's day and when it's night, for it to be nocturnal, 
何時是白天，何時是黑夜。因為它是 "夜間" 活動，

68:10
if you see what I mean, 
如果你明白我的意思， 

68:12
if it was dark all the time, it would never know when it was day when it was night.
如果天一直黑，它就永遠不知道什麼時候是白天什麼時候是晚上。

68:17
and nocturnal activities cued by sunset and sunrise.
而夜行性是根據日落和日出啟示。

68:21
so in the case of nocturnally active creatures,
所以對於夜間活動的生物，

68:24
the fact, that the light signals to the brain to block the melatonin synthesis,
事實上，光向大腦發出信號，以阻止褪黑激素合成。

68:31
whereas in in the active ones, that blocking makes them wake up.
在這樣活動的大腦中，這種阻止使祂們醒來。

68:37
the extraordinary thing is, 
不同尋常的是

68:38
that the biochemistry is changed with the non-internally active ones in that,
生物化學與非內部活性物質發生變化，

68:40
when you block the melatonin synthesis,
當你阻止褪黑激素合成時，

68:44
it sends them to sleep,
它讓他們入睡。

68:46
um and we were looking at... 
嗯，我們正在研究...

68:47
:bearded_person: melatonin production is the exact same for both, it spikes in the evening,
:bearded_person: 兩者的褪黑激素產量完全相同，
它在晚上激增，

68:51
but for nocturnal animals, it makes them have energy, 
但對於夜行動物，它讓他們有能量，

68:53
and for us, it makes us fall asleep.
而對我們來說，它讓我們想睡。

68:56
:older_woman: yes yes, that's right, it is.
:older_woman: 是的 是的，沒錯，就是這樣。

68:58
it's extraordinary, it's it's like the bright light,
這很了不起，就像明亮的光，

69:00
makes it, makes the, um, blocks the meditation,
它，嗯，阻止褪黑激素，

69:02
and when the melatonin starts to drop,
the nocturnal animals go to sleep, because it's daytime.
當褪黑激素開始下降時，夜行動物去睡覺，因為是白天。

69:09
and we looked at that a lot, 
when I was working with primates, when I was working with the zoos.
當我在動物園工作時，和靈長類動物一起，我們看了很多。

69:14
because that's they've done quite a lot of work on that.
因為他們在這方面做了很多工作。

69:18
but I mean, going back to the thing about it, being dark all the time. 
但我的意思是，回到關於 "一直都是黑暗" 的事情。


69:20
there isn't anywhere on the surface of the earth, apart from really deep caves where daylight doesn't penetrate.
地球表面，除了非常深的洞穴外，沒有任何地方日光無法到達。

69:27
because even in a a cave, or a tunnel, you know you can see the light from the outside,
因為即使在洞穴或隧道裡，你也可以看到外面的光，

69:32
you can see the entrance of the tunnel, 
你可以看到隧道的入口，

69:34
you can see whether the sun's there, or it isn't there.
你可以看到太陽是在那裡，或不在。

69:39
and the sun always comes and goes in predictable patterns.
太陽總是以可預測的方式來去。
 
69:43
there's only one place which is really common for it. not to do that. 
只有一種地方不是這樣，而且很尋常。不要這樣做。

69:45
and that's in a windowless room.
那就是一個沒有窗戶的房間。

69:50
or in an opaque rub on a shelf, as you as you pointed out.
或在架子上不透明的(箱?)中，正如你所指。

69:54
and when nocturnal species are studied in the wild, 
當在野外研究夜間活動的物種時，

69:58
we we find that most of them aren't strictly nocturnal,
我們發現它們中的大多數並不是嚴格意義上的夜間活動，

70:00
many of them are ephemeral, 
they're active at any time of the day.
其中許多是短暫的，
它們在任何時間都很活躍。

70:06
francis coskeri has a huge collection of photos of nocturnal geckos from all over the world, that he's photographed out in daylight.

弗朗西斯·科斯凱里 (francis coskeri) 收集了大量來自世界各地的夜行壁虎的照片，

70:11
that he's photographed out in daylight, and even in full sunlight, 
這些照片都是他在白天拍攝的，甚至是充足的陽光下，

70:14
and i've got a few of his pictures too, and some of my own.
我也有一些他的照片，還有一些我自己的。

70:20
um, but the main activity period is often at dusk, or in the early part of the night, 
嗯，但是主要的活動時間往往是在黃昏，或者剛入夜時，

70:24
because that's when the environment is still warm enough for them to be optimally active. 
因為那時環境仍然足夠溫暖，可以使它們處於最佳活動狀態。 

70:29
so their rhythms synchronize with both light and temperature, changing over the course of the day,
所以它們的節奏與光和溫度同步，在一天中不斷變化，
 
70:35
so the study we talked about the tokay gecko altered its body temperature,
所以我們談到大壁虎改變體溫的研究

70:38
because it could sense the bright light  was no longer warming the area below it.
因為它可以感覺到亮光不再使它下面的區域變暖。

70:43
now that's really interesting,
這真的很有趣，

70:45
um, that nocturnal animal is modulating according to the light sees during the day.
嗯，那個夜行動物是根據白天看到的光線進行調節的。

70:54
so yeah, i, I can't see any reason, 
why you would keep an animal without, without... 
at least some exposure to the daylight.
所以是的，我，我看不出有任何理由，為什麼你會在沒有... 至少接觸到日光的情況下飼養動物。
 
70:59
:bearded_person: well, I sort of think...
:bearded_person: 好吧，我有點想...
:older_woman: yeah.
:older_woman: 是的。

71:03
:bearded_person: it's you know, we are a diurnal species,
:bearded_person: 你知道的，我們是晝夜活動的物種，

71:05
so that it would be making the same claim would be saying, 
所以提出同樣的主張，

71:06
well, we never need darkness, 
我們從不需要黑暗，

71:08
because we are active during the light, 
因為我們在亮光中活躍，

71:10
so, we'll just leave the lights on, 
所以，我們就讓燈亮著，

71:11
and imagine how crazy you'd go after three days of that.
想像一下，三天后你會變得多麼瘋狂。 

:older_woman: yeah that's right, and actually, it would be very damaging, yes, it would.
:older_woman: 是的，沒錯，實際上，這將是非常具有破壞性的，是的，它會。
 
71:19
um, but it's amazing how resilient reptiles are.
但令人驚訝的是爬行動物的韌性。

71:21
i mean they can live in in the pitch dark,
我是說他們可以住在在一片漆黑中，

71:23
because people have done so.
因為人們已經這樣做了。

71:25
but their body rhythms have got to be skewed,
但他們的身體節奏將會被扭曲，

71:29
they're skewed, by doing that.
他們被歪曲了，因為這樣。

71:32
:bearded_person: so then you know, theoretically just say you have an animal,
:bearded_person: 那麼你知道，理論上只要說你有一隻動物，

71:33
that spends most of its time in a hide, 
祂大部分時間都隱藏著，

71:35
and it would see the mouth of the hide as the light, and that's going to give its cue.
它會將隱藏處的出口視為光，而那成為祂的提示。

71:36
you could see a keeper saying,
你可以看到一個飼養者說，

71:40
well, why don't I just provide like a simple light bulb,
喔，為何我不能就提供一個簡單的燈泡，

71:42
that's going to signify the day night,
那樣直接代表白天黑夜，

71:44
and why do I need to go to the lengths of going UV full spectrum and infrared?
為什麼我需要深入了解紫外線、全光譜和紅外線？

71:48
if it's only going to be using it as a visual cue, if that makes sense.
如果它只是將它用作視覺提示，如果是這道理。

:older_woman: well, it isn't really, is it.
um the the um...
喔，並不是這樣的，對吧，嗯嗯嗯...

71:56
the UV is in the light, it's it's it's very diluted of course, if the light's very dim.
紫外線在光線中，當然是非常稀釋的，如果光線很暗。
 
72:03
but the proportion of it will be exactly the same,
但比例會是一樣，

72:05
because it's not filtered out by the cave,
因為洞穴不會去過濾它，

72:08
the light that's coming into the cave has the same spectrum, as full sunlight,
進入洞穴的光線具有與完全陽光相同的光譜，
 
72:12
it's just a lot a lot less of it,
只是量少了很多，

72:15
so you're still going to get a lot of UVB,
所以你仍然受到很多的紫外線影響，

72:16
and a lot of animals sleep in crevices in bark and in corners under foliage,
許多動物睡在樹皮的縫隙和樹葉下的角落裡，
 
72:23
they're in daylight all day,
他們在日光下整天，

72:26
and and quite a few, some of the geckos,
還有不少，一些壁虎，

72:28
for example, they sleep on the trunk of the tree, 
例如，他們睡在樹幹上，

72:30
which which gets full light for daylight, 
它在白天獲得充足的日光，

72:32
it may not get actual sunlight because it would be too hot,
它可能不會得到真正的陽光，因為會太熱，

72:34
but, um like I think,
但是，嗯，就像我認為的，

72:36
they're getting UV they're getting quite high levels of UV sometimes, during the day.
他們會受到紫外線影響，在白天有時會得到相當高水平的紫外線。

:bearded_person: and so what about this we were talking earlier, about the thermal conformers,
那麼我們之前談論的這個呢，
關於順應溫度的動物，

72:45
where they are not necessarily using the bright light as a signal for where to bask.
祂們不一定使用強光作為 "在哪裡曬太陽" 的信號。
 
72:51
as far as your concern is, for setting up lighting would be the exact same and you'll let them, 
至於你關心的，照明設置將是完全相同，你會讓他們使用，

72:54
maybe you have more cage decor to dim out the light or,
也許你有更多的籠子飾品來調暗燈光，或者，

72:56
what do you, what are your thoughts there?
你有什麼想法呢？
:older_woman: yeah
:older_woman: 是的

73:00
just I think I think that's a good one actually,
只是我覺得我認為這是一個很好的，

73:02
um, off the top, of my head, I think I just I just try and replicate dappled sunlight.
實際上，嗯，我覺得我只是嘗試複製斑駁的陽光。

73:08
because underneath trees, you always get that mosaic of of bright and dark, 
因為在樹下，你總能看到明暗交錯的馬賽克，

73:12
um it's sometimes, very very small circles of dark and light all into intertwining,
嗯，有時，非常非常小的黑暗和光明圈交織在一起，

73:18
and I would imagine the thermoconformer can see that as well as anyone else.
我想熱成型器也能看到這一點，任何人都可以。

73:23
and, then we'll move into an area which is the right temperature,
然後我們會移動到溫度合適的區域，

73:28
and move around, most of the thermal conformers aren't stripped ammo conformers actually,
並到處移動，大多數溫度適應者實際上不是被剝離的
`"彈藥構想者"?`，

73:32
they, they tend to shift they go up and down trees, 
他們傾向於在樹上上下移動，

73:37
and and move around the bark, 
在樹皮周圍移動，

73:39
um, to to maintain the temperature they want,
嗯，保持他們想要的溫度。

73:41
um, so they are actually so regulating
嗯，所以他們實際上是如此去調節，

73:44
but not in the, in the full basking sense.
但不是都在曬太陽。

73:47
:bearded_person: right, well and I think a story that i've told in the podcast before is,
對，好吧，我想起一個我以前在播客中講過的故事，

73:49
when I created that sort of dappling effect with my jungle carpet python, 
當我在我的叢林地毯蟒蛇的環境弄出那種斑駁的效果時，

73:53
that was the first time i'd seen his natural coloration and his his pattern come into play as far as camouflage goes,
那是我第一次看到祂的自然色彩和圖案發揮偽裝的作用。

74:01
because it was this sort of dappling of the sun, slants of sun, coming through the enclosure, 
因為是傾斜陽光穿過圍欄的這種斑駁，

74:04
and then all of a sudden his, you know, contrast of dark black bars and yellow bars it made perfect sense,
然後突然間他的，你知道的，深黑色條和黃色條的對比都有意義了，

74:11
he became very difficult to see in the back of the enclosure, 
他變得很難在圍欄的後面看到，

74:13
where before, it was like very obvious like there's a yellow and black snake he can't hide anywhere.
以前，很明顯，好像有一條黃黑相間的蛇，哪裡都藏不住。

74:18
but, so, the animals are off evolving in those environments, 
但是，因此，動物在這些(錯誤的)環境中無法進化，

74:21
and they're using that the speckled sun to to be part of their camouflage as well.
他們還利用斑點太陽作為偽裝的一部分。 
:older_woman: yeah makes perfect sense, doesn't it. 
:older_woman: 是的，完全有道理，不是嗎。

74:28
they've evolved to use the environment that they normally live in.
它們已經進化到可以使用它們通常生活的環境。
:bearded_person: yeah. 
:bearded_person: 是。
