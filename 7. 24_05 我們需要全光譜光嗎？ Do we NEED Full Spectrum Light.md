24:03
:bearded_person: Well, why don't we jump into some of the more specifics with this.
:bearded_person: 好吧，我們何不進入一些更具體的內容。

24:07
Because you know, one of the areas that I've been seeing now,
因為你知道，我現在看到的其中一个领域，

24:10
is it sort of seems like... there's two schools of thought beginning to form,
是否有點像... 有兩種思想流派開始形成,

24:14
especially as technology develops, and we have more access to LED bulbs which can be a lot tighter on the spectrum production.
尤其是隨著技術的發展，我們有更多的機會接觸到在頻譜生產上可能更加嚴格的 LED 燈。

24:20 
I see one school of thought that says...
我看到一種思想流派說...

24:22
We should try to strive to provide the full solar spectrum as much as we can, 
as much as the bulbs make it possible.
我們應該努力盡所能，提供完整的太陽光譜，使燈泡能做到。

24:28
And then there's another school of thought,
可能然後還有另一所流派，

24:30
that seems like we can use tighter bandwidths to provide the bands 
that we think are beneficial.
似乎認為我們可以使用更窄的帶寬，提供我們認為有益的頻段。

24:35
So, you know, a tight band for UVB product, our first D3 synthesis, and and... whatever, 
像，你知道，一個局部帶寬的 UVB 產品、我們第一次合成 D3、還有... 其他隨便，

24:41
you know, basically picking and choosing wavelengths of energy for the animal.
你知道，基本上是為動物挑和選擇能量波長，

24:45
We don't have to have the full spectrum, 
we can just have this sort of you know patches of it 
我們不必擁有全譜，我們可以有這樣的，你知道，它的其中一小段。

24:48
So I was curious what your thoughts on there.
所以我很好奇你對那的想法。

24:51
If you've noticed that as well, and where do you sit on that school of thought?
如果你也注意到了這一點，你在思想流派中處於什麼位置？

24:54
:older_woman: Yes, definitely.
:older_woman: 是的，確實。

24:56
I think it's a really good question.
我認為這是一個很好的問題。

24:57
Because people often tackle me on very specific issues they know,
人們經常在他們知道的，非常具體的議題上應付我的問題，

25:00
nearly always related to just "one tiny part of the sun spectrum",
差不多都只和 "太陽光譜的一小部分" 有關，

25:05
like the exact wavelengths involved in vitamin D synthesis.
就像涉及 "維生素 D 合成" 的確切波長；

25:07
Or the exact wavelengths that cue the brain about day length. 
或提示大腦 "白天長度" 的確切波長。

25:12
And that's I think because as human beings,
我認為這是因為，作為人類，

25:15
we're very good at putting things into "categories" and getting very "specific".
我們很擅長把事情「分類」並變得非常「具體」。

25:18
So we get, you know, this is what causes that or we need this to get that.
所以我們能知道，這是甚麼原因造成的，或我們需要這個來得到那個。

25:27
And we divide everything up.
我們把所有東西都分開。

25:29
So we say, this is blue, and that is green.
He is Welsh, I'm English...
所以我們說這是藍色那是綠色、他是威爾士人，我是英國人...

25:33
These reptiles are diurnal and these are not.
這些爬行動物是晝行性的，而這些不是。

25:35
Well, we don't like the distinctions to blur,
and sometimes we don't even have words for it.
我們不喜歡模糊的區別，甚至沒有詞形容。

25:40
um, I mean, for example, we say blue green.
嗯，我是說，例如，藍綠。

25:43
We don't really have a word for the intermediate.
我們真的沒有一個詞來形容 "中間體"。

25:45
We say somebody's half Welsh and half English,
我們說某人一半威爾士一半英國人。

25:50
Well, we do have Cathemeral, so that's that's something,
好吧，我們確實有 "Cathemeral" 那是一個，

25:52
but um.. I think what it's meant is that
但，嗯.. 我認為這意思是，

25:56
we've separated heat from light from UV,
我們已經將熱、光和紫外線區分出來，

25:59
And we've even split these into subdivisions.
而且我們甚至把這些分得更細。

26:01
I mean, don't get me started...
我還可以講更多...

26:03
there's UVB, UVA, infrared a, b, c...
有 UVB、UVA、紅外線 a b c...

26:08
there's blue light green light red,
有藍光、綠光、红光，

26:10
and we've discovered they all do different things.
我們發現他們都做不同的事情。

<!--  -->

26:14
which I mean, perhaps we can talk about that a bit later on,
我是說，也許我們可以稍後再談，

26:15
but but I mean, if we look at this guy um...
但我的意思是，如果我们看看这个家伙，嗯...
![](https://i.imgur.com/1yma0BX.png)

26:20
um this is a little nail monitor that we met in kruger national park in south africa.
嗯，這是我們的一個小指甲監視器，我們在南非克魯格國家公園遇到。

26:26
so what does a reptile respond to?
那麼爬行動物對什麼做出反應？

26:29
what does it see? what does it feel?
祂看到了甚麼？ 祂的感覺如何？

26:31
what does its brain and the cells in its body respond to?
祂的大腦和體內的細胞對什麼做出反應？

26:33
and what has it evolved to benefit from?
以及祂的進化受益於什麼？

26:38
and the answer has to be 
it responds to its entire micro habitat everything around it,
答案是，它對它周圍的一切微棲息地做出反應，

26:43
everything plays at least some role in its life,
任何事物都至少在其生命中扮演著某種角色，

26:48
it's basically it's holistic,
它基本上是整體的，

26:51
and I think that's something that humans are terrible at.
而且我覺得這是人類不擅長的。

26:54
so it's responding to the whole of the sun spectrum, 
from UVB to infrared b, 
in its national `?natural` proportions and amounts in the place where it evolved.
所以它對整個太陽光譜做出反應，從 UVB 到紅外線 b，
以其自然的比例和數量，在它進化的地方。

27:03
so, the lizard, the turtle, the snake,
蜥蜴烏龜蛇

27:07
it's not splitting up light from heat or UV from light.
它不會從熱量中分離出光，或從光中分離出紫外線，

27:12
because sunlight is providing all those.
因為陽光提供了所有這些。

27:13
things together in proportion with each other,
事物彼此成比例地在一起，

27:16
so its instincts are responding to signals from one part of the spectrum, it may be obtaining benefits from all the rest.
所以它的本能對來自頻譜一部分的信號做出反應，它可能會從其餘所有部分那裡獲得好處。

27:25
so if we look at that young nile monitor,
所以如果我們看看那個年輕的尼羅河監視器，

27:28
he's waking up,
祂醒來時，

27:30
he sees a sunlit patch of rock 
祂看到一塊陽光普照的岩石，

27:32
and he goes there just because he knows it will feel good.
祂去那裡，只是因為他知道祂會感覺很好。

27:36
so there he's absorbing energy from the invisible infrared and from the light,
所以他在那裡從不可見的紅外線和光吸收能量，

27:42
and it's warming him up,
這讓他暖和起來。

27:43
so we say he's thermoregulating, 
but what he's actually doing is absorbing all the wavelengths in the sunlight,
所以我們說他在調節體溫，但他實際上正在吸收太陽光所有波長，

27:48
and they all have different functions,
as well as supplying warmth.
並且他們都有不同功能，例如提供溫暖。

27:53
i mean the obvious example is that 
UVB is enabling vitamin D synthesis in his skin.
我的意思是明顯的例子是，uvb 使他的皮膚能夠合成維生素 D。
 
27:58
well his skin has evolved to the right thickness and the right color to absorb the right amount of UVB in the time.
好吧，他的皮膚已經進化到合適的厚度和合適的顏色，可以吸收適量的 uvb。

28:05 
he would normally spend in either direct sun or daylight each day.
他通常每天都在直射陽光或日光下度過。

28:10
and vitamin D synthesis being a two-stage process,
維生素 D 的合成是一個兩階段的過程，

28:12
it also requires warmth, 
so at the same time that the UV is converting the cholesterol in his skin to pre-D3,
the warmth is converting the pre-D3 to vitamin D3.
它還需要溫暖，所以，同時間，
紫外線將皮膚中的膽固醇轉化為 pre-d3，溫暖正在將 pre-D3 轉化為維生素 d3。

28:25
so you say, well, how long is he going to bask for?
所以你說，他要曬多久？

28:27
well, he controls the time he spends in the sunlight,
by a temperature sensitive cells in his brain, (in the how) in the hypothalamus
好吧，他通過大腦下視丘的溫度感應細胞控制他在陽光下度過的時間，

28:37
but also temperature scented nerve endings in his skin, 
and also in various organs of his body,
like just around the heart.
還有他皮膚上帶有溫度氣味的神經末梢，
還有他身體的各個器官 (例如心臟周圍)。

28:45
and these are responding to heat generated from short wavelength infrared in sunlight that reaches him directly,
這些是對 "陽光中短波長紅外線" 產生的熱量的反應，那是直接到祂身上的。 

28:52
as well as to warmth conducted from the skin surface, 
and he's sitting on the rock。
還有從皮膚表面傳導的熱量，他在岩石上。
 
28:56
and it's all part of that same continuous spectrum,
它都是同一個連續譜的一部分，

28:58
everything's interlinked,
一切都是相互關聯的，

29:01
and every year we keep finding new things that reveal yet more complexity,
每年我們都在不斷尋找新事物，揭示更多複雜性，

29:05
it gets more and more complicated and my lectures get longer and longer,
它變得越來越複雜，我的講座越來越長，

29:09
and the importance of not just individual parts of the spectrum,
以及不僅僅是頻譜中個別部分的重要性，

29:11
but also their intensity and their relationship to each other.
還有他們的強度和彼此之間的關係。

29:17

and if we've got a minute,
i'll just i'll just show you some spectra.
如果我們有時間，我只是給你看一些光譜。

29:19
: yeah. 
: 好。
: this is the spectrum of sunlight.
: 這是陽光的光譜。
![](https://i.imgur.com/C0ZIDW3.png)

29:22
um the earth's atmosphere filters out all the very short wavelength stuff.
嗯地球的大氣層過濾掉了所有非常短的波長。

29:27
that's in this direction.
在這個方向。
 
29:30
and it just lets through 
some a little bit of UVB 
from about 295 millimeters 
this wavelength upwards
它只允許一點點 uvb，從大約 295 毫米波長以上，

29:38
just a little bit of UVB, a lot more uva,
只是一點點 uvb，更多的 uva，

29:42
absolute flood shed loads of visible light
絕對氾濫大量的可見光，

29:46
a lot of infrared a and a little bit of infrared b.
大量的紅外線 a 和一點點紅外線 b。

29:50
so life on earth evolved under all of this, 
and it's evolved to use every bit of it.
所以地球上的生命在這一切中進化，已經進化到可以使用它的每一點，

29:53
that it can in all the different biochemical ways，it's it's a continuum.
它可以在所有不同的生化途徑中，這是一個連續體。

30:00
it's like a flood of energy,
它就像一股能量洪流，

30:03
and I think messing up this relationship,
我認為搞砸了這段關係，

30:06
and splitting up heat light and UV artificially by using lamps that are spread out or only producing short wavelengths can lead to some really weird abnormal effects. 
人工地區分離熱、光和紫外線，透過分散的燈來達成，或只產出短波長，可能導致一些非常奇怪的異常效應。

30:16
and there's some quite good experiments,
還有一些很好的實驗，

30:18
actually that have been done over the years.
實際上這些年來已經完成了。

30:20
um, for example, there was a trial done with wall lizards (Podarcis muralis),
嗯，例如，這裡對壁蜥 (紫羅蘭)，進行了一項試驗。
![](https://i.imgur.com/gfWbMld.png)

30:25
what they did was 
they warmed the floor of a cage to a set temperature,
他們所做的是，他們將籠子的地板加熱到設定的溫度，

30:32
and then they shot a narrow beam of light onto one area one little sort of circle,
然後他們將一束窄光束射到一個區域，一個小圓圈上，

30:35
they filtered it to remove the infrared wavelengths,
他們過濾它，以去除紅外波長，

30:38
so it wasn't strong enough to cause any detectable change in the surface temperature  in that little circle
所以它的強度不足以在那個小圓圈中引起任何可檢測的表面溫度變化，

30:46
and they found that the lizards positioned themselves really accurately with their backs under the center of the beam,
他們發現蜥蜴確實準確地將自己的位置放在了光束的中心下方，
 
30:52
although it was no warmer there than anywhere else.
雖然那裡並不比其他任何地方更暖和。

30:56
now ron murin has just done some trials with collared lizards,
現在 ron murin 剛剛對領蜥蜴做了一些試驗，

31:02
and he's found something very similar,
他發現了一些非常相似的東西，

31:04
and if you go to his link on the reptile lighting form,
如果你訪問他關於爬行動物照明表格的鏈接，
![](https://i.imgur.com/xgnSXrV.png)

31:07
you can watch this little video,
你可以觀看這個短片，

31:08
and what he did was 
he tried um three different basking areas 
and he had the same UV for all of them
他所做的是，他嘗試了三種不同曬太陽的區域，他對所有區域都有相同的紫外線。

31:17
and he had all the basking surface temperatures which was there there and there, exactly the same at 32 degrees.
他有那裡所有曬點表面溫度，它們完全相同，在 32 度。
![](https://i.imgur.com/fYZFRXY.png)

31:24
and in one he had a dhp deep heat projector, 
in one he had a halogen, 
and one he had an LED.
一個，他有一個 DHP 深熱投影儀；
一個，他有一個鹵素燈；
一個，他有一個 LED；

31:30
and he timelapsed them and measured how much time they spent,
他延時拍攝祂們，並測量祂們花了多少時間，

31:32
and you can just about see on here,
你可以在這裡看到，

31:34
you've got the collared lizards tending to go to the LED or the halogen, and mostly the LED
領蜥蜴傾向於去 LED 或 鹵素燈，主要是 LED。

31:45
and so what it looks like is that the these sun... 
the sun basking animals are going for the light,
所以它看起來像是，這些曬太陽的動物正在追尋光，

31:49
they're going for what they perceive as a patch of sunlight,
他們尋找他們認為是一片陽光的東西，

31:55
although the warmth is the same on all of them.
雖然祂們身上的溫暖都是一樣的。

31:58
well there was another study done earlier,
好，之前還有另一項研究，

32:00
a peer-reviewed study.
同行評議的研究。

32:04
which um which I can show you, 
那個，嗯，我可以給你看，
![](https://i.imgur.com/fxZVWvE.png)

32:07
um it was using two species of animals.
one species was sun baskers, the crystallitis.
嗯，這使用兩種物種的動物，一種是曬太陽的, crystallitis

32:13
and the second were thermoconformers, the gunglachi.
第二個是熱適應者，gunglachi

32:17
and they kept the whole cage at the either at the preferred body temperature,
他們將整個籠子都保持在最喜歡的體溫下，

32:24
or slightly too warm or slightly too cold.
或稍微熱一點或稍微冷一點。 

32:28
but the cage was half illuminated so half of it was shaded and half was not.
但是籠子裡有一半被照亮，所以一半被遮蔽，另一半沒有。

32:33
but the temperature inside was the same.
但裡面的溫度是一樣的。

32:36
and the sun basking species, they associated brightness with warmth,
然後，曬太陽的物種，他們將亮度與溫暖聯繫起來

32:41
so if the whole cage was cold, they went and sat in the lighted area，
所以如果整個籠子都很冷，他們就去坐在亮處；

32:47
if the whole cage was too hot, 
they all sat in the shaded area.
although the temperatures were completely the same all the way across.
如果整個籠子都太熱了，
他們都坐在陰涼處；
儘管一路上溫度完全相同。

32:55
but the thermoconformers didn't seem to care, they just sat anywhere.
但熱適應者似乎並不關心，他們坐在任何地方。

33:00
because they didn't show that preference,
因為他們沒有表現出這種偏好，

33:02 
so they weren't using sunlight as an indicator of heat.
所以他們沒有使用陽光作為熱量的指標。

33:06
presumably because in the areas where they live, the sunlight isn't producing hot sunbeams, that then they don't bask.
大概是因為在他們居住的地區，太陽光不是那種熾熱的陽光，所以他們不會曬太陽。
> 動物從他們的環境和經驗學習，此因素在挑選實驗動物時，有考慮過嗎？
> 例如與人密切生活的動物可能受到夜晚開燈的影響而晚睡。


33:13
so it's so it's quite interesting to find that different species going to vary,
所以很有趣，發現不同的物種會有所不同，

33:15
but they're all using their environment to decide what they do.
但他們都在利用他們的環境來決定他們做什麼。

33:21
but it's actually more complicated even than that,
但實際上比這更複雜，

33:25
because when we set up, our lamps we always say,
因為當我們設置燈時，我們總是說，

33:28
you know we should have the bright light over the basking zone,
你知道我們應該在曬太陽區有明亮的光線，

33:33
and that will make a little patch of sunlight
這將產生一小片陽光

33:36
but people say, well, 
why do you have to do that,
you know they put the light down one end of the UV up the other end.
但人們說，嗯，
為什麼你必須這樣做，你知道，
一邊放燈光一邊放紫外線。
 
33:39
well there was a really good study done with Tokay gecko which were the nocturnal ones, of course.
有一項非常好的研究，是用大守宮完成的，當然祂們是夜間活動的。 
 
33:47
and what they did, they set up the first test.
他們做了什麼，他們設置了第一個測試。

33:51
very much like the previous ones, 
和以前的很像，

they had a heater down one end with the bright light, and a shield, 
他們在有一個加熱器一端朝下有明亮的燈光，和一個掩護，

so that it wasn't the light that was causing the warmth.
所以它不是光這造成溫暖。
![](https://i.imgur.com/bCzne7M.png)

34:00
and they put the tokyo geckos in there。
他們把東京壁虎放在那裡。

34:03
and they found that,
他們發現，

34:04
over 24 hours with the light going on and going off again,
超過 24 小時的開關燈的循環，

34:09
the geckos had a kind of a circadian rhythm in preferred body temperature, so they would change their body temperature day and night.
壁虎在他們喜歡的體溫中，有一種晝夜節律，所以他們會在日夜改變他們的體溫。

34:18 
and the most precise thermo regulation, they were doing during the night, when they were active, which is kind of what you'd expect.
和最精確的溫度調節，他們在夜間進行，當他們活躍時，這正是你所期望的。

34:26
but when the bright light 
was positioned over the wrong end 
over the cold end,
但是當明亮的光線位於冷端上方的錯誤端時，
![](https://i.imgur.com/NNHAgK0.png)

34:31
which is a very odd place for the light to be. 
以光來說這是一個非常奇怪的位置。

34:32
what happened then was that, the geckos lowered their body temperature all together,
然後發生的事情是壁虎一起降低了體溫，

34:39
and they lost the circadian rhythm,
他們一起失去了晝夜節律，

34:42
they also thermoregulated less precisely at night,
它們在夜間的溫度調節也不太精確，

34:46
so it was almost as if they were sensing there was no warmth in the sun anymore,
所以就好像他們感覺到陽光下沒有溫暖了。

34:51
and that was changing the way they were regulated.
這改變他們調節的方式。

34:55
well in a third scenario,
在第三個場景，

34:58
they put a uniform gentle light over the whole area to see what they would do.
他們在整個區域設置均勻柔和的光，看看他們會做什麼。
![](https://i.imgur.com/0VNHOa7.png)

35:03
and they discovered it was very much like the first one.
他們發現它和第一個第一個實驗很像。

35:07
where the light was at one end,
在光的那端，

35:10
they still had their daily rhythms on and off and didn't face them at all.
他們仍然有他們的日常節奏，根本沒有 `?`面對他們。

35:17
but the cruelest thing was that this group of researchers sievert and hutchinson,
但最殘忍的是，這群研究人員希沃特和哈欽森，

35:22
they then did it with colored lizards,
他們後來用彩色蜥蜴做了這個實驗，


35:25
and these are diurnal species completely different,
這些是完全不同的晝夜物種，

35:29
and they found that 
they lost their natural rhythmic swings,
when the uniform lighting they were given there wasn't any basking lamp,
他們發現，當給他們提供均勻的照明，沒有任何曬點燈的情況下，他們失去了自然的節奏搖擺，

35:38
there was there was no sun patch.
沒有設置 "太陽光" 修補機制。
: wow 
: 哇

35:39
: so, what does that tell us about, `?`tell we very lighting and how important it is to get it right.
: 那麼，這告訴我們什麼，告訴我們 `?`非常照明以及使其正確的重要性。

35:46
to recreate the natural situation 
for the animal as best we can,
盡我們所能為動物重建自然環境，

35:50
and they also were also studies have done,
when day length has changed.
他們也進行當晝長變化的研究，

35:54
that also alters the preferred body temperatures and the basking preferences,
這也會改變偏好的體溫，以及曬太陽的喜好，
  
36:00
because day length changes with seasons and so do
因為白天的長度隨著季節而變化，爬行動物行為也是如此。

36:04
reptile behaviors it's like they're hardwired to the patterns of sunlight.
爬行動物的行為就像它們與日光模式一樣。

36:09
that they would have experienced as they evolved over days and over the years.
他們在經歷幾天和數年的進化過程中會經歷過這種模式。

36:14
: that is incredible it's it's amazing.
: 太不可思議了，太神奇了。

36:18
how much you could mess it up by, really, how long you can get it?
你會有多少可能搞砸，真的，你花了多久能得到它？

36:20
: well yeah and and we're learning.
you know we always talk about putting the lights in a certain place and and that...
: 嗯，是的，我們正在學習。
你知道我們總是談論將燈放在某個地方...

36:26
but it really is it really makes a difference.
但這真的很重要。
 
36:31
and I think we've only talked about separating light and infrared,
我想我們只談過關於分離光和紅外線 um

36:35
um, experiments have been done with different... different parts of the visible light,
嗯，實驗已經完成，用可見光的不同部分...

36:39
different coloured light on basking.
曬不同顏色的太陽光。
![](https://i.imgur.com/w3ftwYq.png)

36:42
there was another experiment done,
還有另一個實驗也完成了，

36:44
with the wall lizards.
和壁蜥一起完成的。

36:46
and they kept the temperature constant,
他們保持溫度恆定，

36:47
but the visible light started off with being white light,
但是可見光從白光開始，

36:51
then they changed it by putting filters across, to remove parts of the spectrum.
然後他們通過放置過濾器去除部分頻譜改變它，

36:56
and first of all they removed any blue light below 48 nanometers,
首先他們去除了任何低於 48 奈米的藍光，

36:59 
so there's still a tiny bit of sort of turquoisey blue,
but most of the blue had gone.
所以仍然有一點點綠松石藍色，但大部分藍色已經消失了。

37:03
and of course the uva wasn't there in the first place.
當然，uva 一開始就不存在。

37:07
and then they removed the blue and the green,
然後他們移除藍色和綠色，

37:09
so it leaves a little bit of green,
所以它留下一點點綠色，

37:11
but mostly the oranges and reds.
但主要是橙紅色。

37:14
and what they discovered that
他們發現

37:16
when they just removed the blue wavelengths this one
當他們剛剛移除藍色波長時

37:20
it it left a sort of greenish yellow light to our eyes,
它留下了一種在我們看來是綠黃色的光，

37:24
we don't quite know what color it was to the lizards.
我們不太清楚對蜥蜴是什麼顏色，

37:26
but they didn't change their thermoregulating behavior much at all.
但祂們溫調節的行為根本沒有改變體。

37:32
they didn't change the rate of warming,
他們沒有改變變暖的速度、

37:33
they didn't change the amount of time they spent basking.
他們沒有改變他們花在曬太陽上的時間。

37:36
but when they removed the blue and most of the green,
leaving the yellow orange and red,
但是當他們去除藍色和大部分綠色時，只剩下黃橙色和紅色，

37:42
the lizards reduced their preferred body temperature,
蜥蜴降低了它們喜歡的體溫，

37:44
they reduced their rate of heat gain and they basked for longer,
他們降低了熱量增加的速度，並且他們曬太陽的時間更長。

37:49
so the color of the light, the lack of these wavelengths,
所以光的顏色，這些波長的缺乏，

37:52
changed the way they behaved.
改變了他們的行為方式。

37:56
: wow 
: 哇，
: and when you think the way we light our animals,
: 當你思考我們供光給動物的方式時，

37:59
you know it really, we don't know this, we we just don't.
你知道，真的，我們不知道這一點，我們就是不知道。

38:04
well the authors of the study what they did was 
那麼這項研究的作者他們所做的就是，

38:06
they speculated that blue light is the strongest inhibitor of melatonin,
他們推測藍光是褪黑激素最強的抑製劑，

38:12
so the effect could be due to the removal of the blue wavelengths,
所以效果可能是由於去除了藍色波長，

38:14
allowing the brain to synthesize melatonin
而使大腦合成褪黑激素。 

38:19
and that hormone has powerful effects on daily rhythms,
並且這種荷爾蒙對日常節奏有強大的影響，

38:22
and it does include thermoregulation in in reptiles,
它確實包括爬行動物的體溫調節，

38:27
well, I think the relevance to this in real life is that 
好吧，我認為在現實生活中與此相關的是，
![](https://i.imgur.com/IjHbVIh.png)

38:28
when the sun is low in the sky, as it is in sunrise sunset, and all day in the winter in higher latitudes, there's less blue in the sunlight .
當太陽在天空中很低時，例如它在日出、日落或在高緯度冬天一天中，陽光中藍色很少。

38:35
and at night of course there's none so blue is a very important wavelength for modifying circadian seasonal rhythms.
當然晚上沒有，所以藍色是改變晝夜節律的非常重要的波長。
 
38:44
because it acts as a really powerful signal to the brain,
因為它對大腦起到了非常強大的信號作用，

38:49
saying it's daytime.
說是白天。

38:51
so I think these are just a couple of examples,
所以我認為這些只是幾個例子，

38:53
i mean sunlight and its effects can't really be separated up into heat, light and uv,
我的意思是陽光及其影響，真的不能只分成熱、光和紫外線，

38:59
we haven't even mentioned UV yet.
我們甚至還沒有提到 uv。

39:01
um what's more that,
the sun spectrum has very specific amounts of each wavelength,
嗯，更重要的是，
太陽光譜中每個波長都有非常具體的數量，

39:06
all of which are used for something by the body,
所有這些都被身體用於某些事情，

39:09
and all of which vary with time of day, time of year, 
and we only know some of those uses.
所有這些都隨著一天中的時間、一年中的時間而變化，
我們只知道其中的一些用途。
 
39:15
we keep finding more,
我們不斷發現更多，

39:17
and the questions are still just as relevant,
as they've always been 
how much of each wavelength does each species need?
而問題仍然同樣相關，一如往常
因為它們一直是，每個物種需要多少波長？
  
39:24
does the amount vary with season?
does it vary with time of day?
它的量是否隨季節變化？
它是否隨著一天中的時間而變化？

39:26
we haven't any clear answers,
we haven't even any clear answers for the way that, um, uv, 
我們沒有明確的答案，
那方面關於 uv，我们甚至没有任何明确的答案，

39:32
we just have crude estimates for the uv, 
我們只有對紫外線的粗略估計，

39:36
and certainly only crude estimates for the temperature,
當然對溫度也只是粗略估計，

39:38
which is not even the same as the infrared.
甚至與紅外線不同。

39:40
and we have almost nothing for visible light at all,
且我們幾乎沒有可見光的信息，

because no one's gone out there and measured it, in the wild.
因為沒有人在野外測量過它。 
 
39:47
: right
: 對

39:48
: so we can't really pull apart the spectrum
: 所以我們不能真正分離光譜

39:50
and provide these important spikes of energy,
並提供這些重要的能量尖峰，
 
39:55
because the only thing we can deduce 
from the evidence we're collecting 
is that it's all important!
因為從我們收集的證據來看，
唯一可以推斷的是，都很重要！

39:58
: right 
: 是的
every time we look into something we find another piece of importance
每次我們往某件事深入，我們都會發現另一件重要事情的一部分。

40:02 
: and I think we really,
: 我認為我們真的，

40:04
we do need to reproduce it as faithfully as we can.
我們確實需要盡可能忠實地複制它。

40:06
um but it is actually really difficult,
嗯，但實際上真的很難，

40:08
because not only is this sunlight a continuum from UVB right through to infrared,
因為這種陽光不僅是從 UVB 一直到紅外線的連續體，

40:14
it's also changing from dawn to dusk,
也是從黎明到黃昏，

40:18
from winter to summer,
from full sun to full shade.
從冬天到夏天，
從充足的陽光到完全陰影。

40:22
and it's changing in spectrum as well as intensity,
它的光譜和強度都在變化，

40:24
so, it's a big puzzle, it really is.
這是一個大謎題，它真的是。

40:29
: yeah, it absolutely is, and as you look into it further, you realize how complicated.
: 是的，它絕對是，當你進一步研究它時，你會意識到它有多複雜。

40:32
and it sort of reminds me of almost like the difference between eastern and western medicine.
這讓我想起了東西方醫學的差異。

40:35
you know eastern medicine is a lot more holistic,
你知道，東方醫學更重視全面性，

40:40
they will provide like an herb or a plant and you take the whole thing.
他們會給你像藥草或植物，你拿到整個東西。

40:42
where western medicine goes,
西醫則是，

40:43
okay, what alkaloid in that plant is usable,
好的， 那植物中的什么生物鹼可以用，

40:46
and we turn that into a pill。
我們把它變成藥丸。

40:48
where the eastern medicine says,
東方醫學則說，

40:49
no you have to have the whole plant the whole plant is important
不，你必須擁有整株植物，整株植物很重要。

40:51
and I think that's a decent analogy for what we're kind of doing here
我認為這對於我們在這裡所做的，是一個很好的類比。

40:56
: yeah, as long as, as long as we don't end up thinking we can use body parts of animals for correct,
: 是的，只是到最後可別想說動物身體的啥部位有啥功用 (別想打動物身體的主意)。

41:00
: yes, yes, yeah, exactly,

41:04
yeah, there's, there's certain parts of eastern medicine that we want to stay away from.
是的，東方醫學的某些部分，我們想遠離。 

41:07
but uh so as far as...
但據我所知是的...

41:09
: I know, yeah, you, what you mean is the holistic side of it.
: 你的意思是我們開始理解它的整體方面。

41:13
we're beginning to understand it, um.
我們開始明白了，嗯。

41:16
there's aspects in medicine which are getting better,
醫學的某些方面正在變得越來越好，

41:19
but that's beside the point is tip for what we're talking about.
但這不是我們談論的重點。
