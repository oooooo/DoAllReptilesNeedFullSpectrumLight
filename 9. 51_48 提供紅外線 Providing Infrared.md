:bearded_person: yeah, so what about, we’ve sort of mentioned a little bit of infrared, so…
:bearded_person: 是的，那麼，我們已經提到了一點紅外線，所以，

51:52
we've talked about the the UV and visible light, 
我們已經討論過紫外線和可見光，

51:53
and I think we'll get into a little more detail about those, especially invisible light, 
in a second,
我想我們緊接著會更詳細地了解這些，尤其是不可見光。
 
51:58
but as far as rounding that spectrum out,
the terrestrial solar spectrum,
但就四捨五入這個地球太陽光譜而言，
"除了整理出光譜之外，
那是否代表你對於紅外線的看法?"

52:00
on that one graph, 
you had halogen, 
is that kind of what you mainly recommend, 
as far as getting into that? infrared a?
在那張圖上，你用了鹵素，
那是您主要推薦使用的嗎？就進入該領域而言，紅外線 a。

52:08
:: yeah the the infrared I think the halogen lap covers it pretty well.
:: 是的，紅外線，我認為鹵素圈覆蓋得很好。
52:10
um, I can do a little bit more sharing of screen stuff.
嗯，我可以多做一點分享屏幕上的東西。

52:14
we were looking at this part of the sunlight,
我們正在看陽光(光譜)的一部分，

52:18
but earlier we saw that the sunlight has a second half,
但前面我們看的陽光(光譜)，還有後半部分，

52:20
well, it's actually 48 that's infrared, 
後半部其實是 48 那是紅外線。
 
52:25
and that's all of this.
這是全部。
![](https://i.imgur.com/yAA6gEv.png)

52:28
and you can see that the sunlight is mostly infrared a,
你可以看到陽光是主要是紅外線 a。

52:32
well the halogen lamp, covers that pretty well,
嗯，鹵素燈蓋得很漂亮
![](https://i.imgur.com/miGol0T.png)

52:35
that's the spectrum of a halogen lamp, so,
那是鹵素燈的光譜，所以，

52:38
as long as you've got something good for the visible light,
只要你做了有益於可見光的要求，

52:40
you're getting a lot of your infrared a from one of those.
從那些之中你已經得到很多紅外線。

52:42
it fits it quite nicely,
它符合得很好，

52:45
there's a little bit longer wavelength, 
它波長有一點稍長，

52:46
but basically, it's it's covering what we want,
但基本上，它涵蓋了我們要的。

52:51
so, that's quite good.
所以，這很好。

52:53
and another one, a patio heater, is almost as good, for very large enclosures.
另一個，露台加熱器，幾乎同樣好，用於非常大的外殼。
![](https://i.imgur.com/55YxUYU.png)

52:58
you know like 1.5 kilowatts.
您知道的，例如 1.5 千瓦。

53:00
they're really good ofcourse you lose the visible light from the halogen,
它們真的很好，當然鹵素燈，你會犧牲可見光，

53:04
because they're mainly just glowing in orange and red.
因為它們主要發出橙色和紅色的光。

53:08
but you've still got the infrared able,
但你還有紅外線功能。

53:09
this is why we talk about these,
這就是我們談論這些的原因，

53:11
these patio heaters for the zoo enclosures,
they're very very good.
這些用於動物園圍欄的露台加熱器，
他們非常非常好。 

53:17
so, those are basically your basking lamps,
所以那些基本上是你的曬太陽
53:19
燈

53:21
now, there's the heat projector which is getting obviously a lot of interest,
現在，熱投影儀 (HP) 顯然引起了很多人的興趣，
![](https://i.imgur.com/fAeNGRP.png)

53:23
and, it's a carbon filament lamp, 
and what that means, is that,
而且，它是一個碳絲燈，
這意味著什麼，

53:28
it's very very good for warming the environment,
它非常非常有利於環境變暖，

53:30
because it's got a lot of infrared b,
因為它有很多紅外線b，

53:32
and a lot of short wave, a longer wavelength light,
和很多~~短波~~更長波長的光，

but it hasn't got very much infrared a,
但它沒有太多的紅外線a.

53:39
so it's very good for warming things.
所以它非常適合加熱東西。

53:42
but it's not really suitable as a basking lamp,
但它真的不適合作為曬太陽的燈，

53:47
and if we look at the, um, the ceramic heat emitters,
如果我們看看，嗯，陶瓷熱發射器 (CHE 陶瓷燈)，
![](https://i.imgur.com/N3szSbj.png)

53:49
they're far worse altogether.
他們總體上要糟糕得多。

53:52
because as you can see,
正如你所看到的，
![](https://i.imgur.com/G3jYJ0h.png)

53:54
they've got no IR a, virtually no IR b,
他們沒有 IR a，幾乎沒有 IR b，

53:57
and they don't even start producing IR C
而且甚至沒有產生 IR c。

54:00
until two thousand three thousand nanometers
直到 2000 3000 納米。

54:04
so, they're really only environmental heaters,
所以，它們真的只是環境加熱器，

54:07
they're heating, um,
they're heating the air,
they're hitting the surroundings, 
他們加熱了、嗯、他們加熱空氣、他們加熱周圍，

54:11
they're certainly not basking lamps.
so that's my sort of take on basking lamps.
他們肯定不能作為曬太陽的燈。
所以這就是我對曬燈的看法。

54:16
um, and I think that's pretty pretty much all I want to say about those.
嗯，我想這幾乎就是我想說的。

54:22
:bearded_person: yeah, so, a deep heat projector would be perfect,
:bearded_person: 是的，那麼如果你需要保持夜間溫度之類，

54:23
if you need to maintain a nighttime temperature type thing,
一個深熱投影儀將會很完美，

54:27
that's not going to disrupt the day night cycle.
它不會打亂晝夜循環。 

54:30
:older_woman: the reason they're good is that they heat directly, 
:older_woman: 它們很好的原因是它們直接了當是加熱，

54:32
and they heat the ground below,
它們加熱下面的地面，

54:34
they don't just heat the air,
and the surroundings,
它們不只是加熱空氣，
和周圍的環境，

54:36
so, you're warming the substrate, 
所以，你正在加熱基質，

54:39
which is basically like you know the hot pavement at night, 
這基本上就像你知道晚上很熱的人行道一樣，

54:41
which we all go looking for snakes on, that kind of warmth,
我們都去那裏找蛇，那種溫暖，

54:47
so, that's that's producing that kind of heat.
它的產出就是那種熱。

54:49
it's not basking heat at all, 
it's it's environmental,
:bearded_person: yeah.
:older_woman: they're very good for that very very good for that.
他們完全不是曬太陽的熱，
他們是環境的熱，
:bearded_person: 是， 
:older_woman: 作為那樣他們非常好，非常非常好。
