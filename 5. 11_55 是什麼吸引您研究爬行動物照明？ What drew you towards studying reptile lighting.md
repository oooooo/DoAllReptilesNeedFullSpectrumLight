11:55
But about a year later,
但大約一年後，

11:57
our beloved male beardy Pog fell, only about two feet off his basking branch.
我們心愛的公鬆獅 pog 從他曬太陽的樹枝上掉下來，大約只有 2 英尺 (約 60 公分)，

12:03
and he damaged his hip and it turned out he had MBD，and I was absolutely appalled,
他弄傷了他的臀部，結果證明他有 MBD，我非常震驚。

12:08
And I tried to find out why, 
我試圖找出原因，

12:12
and to my amazement, I discovered that no one not even the manufacturers 
令我驚訝的是，我發現沒有人，甚至製造商，

12:15
actually could tell me what UVB output their labs were emitting.
能告訴我實際上他們實驗室發射的 UVB 輸出了什麼。

12:20
:bearded_person: wow.
:bearded_person: 哇。

12:20
:older_woman: so that was a bit of a shock.
And of course, being me, I just thought, 
I'm not having this, I'm going to sort this out.
:older_woman: 所以這有點令人震驚。
當然，對我而言，我只是覺得，
我不接受這個，我要解決這個問題。

12:26
so I discovered another new forum,
it was called "the UVB meter owners".
所以我發現了另一個新論壇，被稱為 "紫外線測量儀使用者"。

12:32
It was an American forum,
這是一個美國論壇，

12:34
and I learned of something called a "solar meter",
我學會了一種叫做 "太陽測量儀 (solar meter)" 的東西，

12:36
one of these 
像這個。

:bearded_person: Was that a reptile form, or was that just something...
:bearded_person: 那是爬行動物用的還是... 

:older_woman: It was UVB meters for reptiles, yeah.
:older_woman: 這是用於爬行動物的 UVB 計，是的。

:bearded_person: Okay.
:bearded_person: 好喔。

12:44
:older_woman: And it was just starting up. People had just heard of these and decided to buy them.
:older_woman: 它只是剛剛起步，人們剛剛聽說這些並決定購買它們。

12:49
um, they were manufactured originally for tiny lamps this kind of thing.
嗯，它們最初是為很小的燈這種東西製造的。

12:55
And through that form, I met an electronics engineer,
He was also a chameleon specialist, his name was Andy.
通過那個論壇，我遇到了一個電子工程師，
他也是變色龍專家，他叫安迪；

13:00
Beveridge and two other friends, Rob Lane and Rachel Hitch，
貝弗里奇和另外兩個朋友 --- --- 羅布·萊恩和瑞秋·希奇。

13:06
And we imported with a great deal of difficulty, 
the first solar meter into the UK.
我們經歷重重困難，將第一個 centimeters 進口到英國。

13:12
When I got mine I soon discovered that
當我拿到我的時，我很快發現

13:14
this amazing mercury vapor lamp was indeed amazing, 
but it was amazingly bad.
這個驚人的汞蒸氣燈確實很驚人，但它是驚人地糟糕。

13:19
And I vowed that I'd test every UVB lamp on sale in the UK.
我發誓我要測試每一個在英國發售的 UVB 燈。

13:25
Well at that time there were only three manufacturers,
so it didn't seem too big a task.
嗯，當時只有三個廠家，
所以這似乎不是一項太大的任務。

13:30
But then, this guy named Bob Mccarter from America,
但後來這個叫鮑勃·麥克卡特的人，來自美國堡壘，

13:34
~`on the Fort,`~ through the forum, sent me samples of a new invention the "Mega Ray", and all the way from north carolina.
通過論壇，給我寄來了一個新發明的樣本 --- --- "Mega Ray"，一路從北卡羅來納州。

13:44
he sent them and he sent a ballast as well, 
so I could use the English voltage with the american map.
他也寄了鎮流器，所以我可以在美國燈泡上使用英國電壓。

13:50
And everything got really busy after that.
之後一切都變得非常忙碌。

13:51
So I guess that's really how I got into looking at reptiles.
所以我想這就是我真正開始研究爬行動物。
 
<!--  -->
13:59
:bearded_person: It's a great story, and I think, I'm sure it must have been. 
:bearded_person: 這是一個很棒的故事，我想，我確定它是。

14:01
Because he said, you know, 
people were using UV back in the late 90s and mid 90s and whatnot.
因為他說，你知道，人們在 90 年代末和 90 年代中期使用紫外線等等等。

14:05
But I'm sure having that experience of measuring that first bulb, 
must have just opened up this giant spider web of confusion.
但我敢肯定，測量第一個燈泡的經驗，一定剛剛打開了這個巨大的混亂的蜘蛛網。

14:15
and where do we go from here?
而我們之後會走到哪裡？

14:17
And so, what did you do next?
那麼接下來你做了什麼？

14:19
Once you started testing balls, were you like...
一旦你開始測試球，你...

14:21
:older_woman: Oh right, yeah, well this is yeah.
:older_woman: 哦，是的、是的。

14:23
This is really how the "UV guide" started.
這其實是 "UV 指南" 如何開始的。

14:26
Well I had my three new friends,
and I created this website called UV guide in 2005.
好，我有了三個新朋友，我在 2005 年創建了這個名為 UV 指南的網站。

14:34
and I can just show you that, actually, um yeah, 
this is our little website to publish our findings.
我可以給你看，實際上，嗯，是的，
這就是我們發表我們發現的[小網站](http://www.uvguide.co.uk/)：  
![](https://i.imgur.com/cFPitGG.png)


14:40
Well unfortunately that 
that little website hasn't been updated for years,
不幸的是，那個小網站多年來都沒有更新。

14:44
I've just never had time to do it, but that was the beginning.
我只是從來沒有時間這樣做，但這就是開始。

14:47
And Andy Beveridge then gave me his spectrometer on semi-permanent loan.
然後 安迪·貝弗里奇 把他的光譜儀半永久借給了我。

14:51
Well, I'd never seen a spectrometer, I didn't know anything about it. 
But he taught me how to use it.
我從未見過我沒有見過的光譜儀，對此一無所知。
但他教會了我如何使用它。

15:00
Well... the other two in the group kind of moved on to other things,
然後... 小組中的其他兩個有點轉移到其他事情上，

15:01
But Andy and I kept on testing.
但安迪和我持續在測試。

15:03
And we even took the meters and the spectrometer on field trips.
我們甚至在實地考察中帶上了測試儀和光譜儀。
 
15:09
And this is us in Mindo Cloud Forest, in Ecuador.
這就是我們在厄瓜多的明多雲霧森林
![厄瓜多的明多雲霧森林](https://i.imgur.com/dqRgm16.jpg)

15:13
And we're taking a spectrum of the light 
in the um... in the canopy, under the canopy.
我們在取得光的光譜，在呃... 樹冠中...在樹冠下。

15:22
And um, it was a wonderful holiday,
嗯，這是一個美妙的假期，

15:24
that was we went to Galápagos.
我們去科隆群岛。

15:26
And this is me in Nourlangie in Kakadu in Australia.
這是我在澳洲卡卡杜的諾蘭吉。
![澳洲卡卡杜的諾蘭吉](https://i.imgur.com/T17OVx6.png)

15:30
And after that, for every holiday I went,
I was an absolute nightmare.
之後，我去的每個假期，我絕對就是一個噩夢。

15:34
Because I was forever going stop the car,
when you take a UV lifting every hour.
我總是一直停車，因為我要取得每小時一次的紫外線變化。

15:39
So I look at my watch, 
and I say need time to stop for another reason.
所以我會看著我的手錶說，需要停下來一會兒，因為某個原因。

15:44
But you know, you get you get really excited about these things. Well I do.
但你知道，你真的對這些事情感到興奮。好吧，我是。

15:47
:bearded_person: And you got to get that data,
:bearded_person: 而你必須得到那些數據，

15:51
and that's the thing is, back then, 
it was understood, that you needed to be there.
But there was just no data behind it, Right?
事情是這樣的，那時，可以理解，你必須在那裡。
因為那後面就是沒有數據，對吧？

15:57
It was just by your bulb and then that was it.
只有你的燈泡，只有這樣。

15:59
:older_woman: yeah. And of course, in 2006 we got these,
:older_woman: 是的。當然，在 2006 年我們得到了這些。

16:02
we got the UV index meters, which made a huge difference.
我們得到了紫外線指數計，它造成了巨大的不同。

16:06
:bearded_person: right. 
:bearded_person: 是的。

:older_woman: um, but you know, Back to the story. 
if I just, um, stop that, um, well, um...
:older_woman: 嗯，但你知道，回到故事中。
~~我要，嗯，取消那個 (圖片)，嗯...~~

16:14
Andy introduced me to the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
安迪向我介紹了英國和愛爾蘭動物園協會和水族館，

16:17
BIAZA for short, and the Zoo World.
簡稱 BIAZA，還有動物園世界。

16:21
And zookeeper Douglas Sheriff who was then at Chester Zoo 
had been working a lot with UV.
當時在切斯特動物園的園長，道格拉斯雪佛，一直在研究紫外線。

16:28
When he invited me, to present our work, at my first zookeepers conference, which was a Blackpool Zoo in 2005.
當他邀請我去簡報我們做的事，那是 2005 年，黑池動物園，我初次動物園管理員會議。

16:37
Um, and maybe it wouldn't have gone much further,
嗯，也許它不會更進一步，

16:39
but between 2006 and 2007,
但在 2006 年和 2007 年之間，

16:43
a lot of the reptile supply companies were jumping on the bandwagon
許多爬行動物供應公司都趕上潮流

16:45
and trying to provide ever stronger UVB lamps.
試圖提供更強大的 UVB 燈。

16:51
And there came up a problem with lamps from several of the major manufacturers, um, supplying...
然後一些燈出現了問題，來自幾家主要製造商，嗯，供應了...

16:57
They were causing UVB burns to eyes, and skin, and a horrifying 10 death rate in younger animals,
它們導致 UVB 灼傷眼睛和皮膚並且在年幼動物上有高達 10% 的死亡率。

17:03
:bearded_person: wow.
:bearded_person: 喔。

:older_woman: No one could work out why.
:older_woman: 沒有人可以找出原因，

17:07
Because the total UVB readings with the UV meters were quite low.
因為用紫外線測量儀的總 UVB 的讀數相當低。

17:12
But there were some amazing people on the forums across the world, and I started collecting case histories from them.
但是世界各地都有一些了不起的人，在論壇上。我開始從他們那裡收集到案例歷史。

17:18
And they even sent me samples of the lamps.
他們甚至寄給我燈的樣品。

17:21
And there was one American forum "radiosliders.com", I think that's right.
有一個美國論壇 "radiosliders.com" 應該沒錯。

17:27
And they they produced a dossier of all the lamps that they had problems,
他們製作了一份他們有問題的，所有燈具的檔案，

17:33
with and they then sent a whole box full of these lamps 
right across the pond for me to test.
然後他們把一整箱裝滿這些燈的盒子送到池塘對面讓我測試。

17:39
well with the help of the spectrometer and the UV index meter,
在光譜儀和紫外線指數計的幫助下，

17:41
what I discovered was that they were all emitting unnaturally short wavelengths uvb,
我發現它們都發出不自然的短波長 UVB，

17:48
which isn't found in sunlight, but not uvc, 
but only tiny amounts of this short wavelengths UVB could could burn the eyes.
這波長的 UVB 在陽光中沒有，也不是 UVC，
但只有這種極少量的短波 UVB 會灼傷眼睛。
 
17:57
Well the companies did believe all the reports we sent,
這些公司確實相信我們發送的所有報告，

17:59
and the affected lamps were withdrawn.
而受影響的燈具已被撤回。

18:02
And they realized what the problem was.
他們意識到問題出在哪裡。

18:05
And after that,
在那之後，

18:07
they started getting me to screen their prototype replacements.
他們開始讓我篩選他們的原型替代品。
 
18:10
which was quite amazing really,
真是太神奇了，

18:13
and then other companies started sending me samples to test for them too,
然後其他公司也開始寄樣品給我測試，

18:17
and it was like the business took off.
就像生意起飛一樣。
