11:55
But about a year later,
但大約一年後，

11:57
our beloved male beardy Pog fell,
only about two feet off his basking branch.
我們心愛的公鬆獅蜥，從他曬太陽的樹枝上掉下來，只有大約兩英尺，

12:03
and he damaged his hip and it turned out he had MBD，and I was absolutely appalled,
他弄傷了他的臀部，結果證明他有 MBD，我非常震驚，

12:08
and I tried to find out why, 
我試圖找出原因，

12:12
and to my amazement, 
i discovered that no one not even the manufacturers 
令我驚訝的是，我發現沒有人甚至製造商，

12:15
actually could tell me what uvb output their labs were emitting
實際上可以告訴我他們實驗室發射的 uvb 輸出了什麼。

12:20
: wow
: 哇

12:20
: so that was a bit of a shock, 
and of course, being me, I just thought, 
i'm not having this, i'm going to sort this out,
: 所以這有點令人震驚，當然，作為我，我只是想，
我不要這樣，我要解決這個問題。

12:26
so I discovered another new forum,
it was called the uvb meter owners.
所以我發現了另一個新論壇，被稱為紫外線計擁有者。

12:32
it was an american forum,
這是一個美國論壇，

12:34
and I learned of something called a solar meter,
我學會了一種叫做太陽能計 (solar meter) 的東西，

12:36
one of these was that a reptile form, 
or was that just something like uvb meters for reptiles, yeah okay.
其中之一形式是爬行動物，或者用於爬行動物的 uvb 計之類的東西，好。

12:44
and it was just starting up.
people had just heard of these and decided to buy them.
它只是剛剛起步，人們剛剛聽說這些並決定購買它們。

12:49
um, they were manufactured originally for tiny lamps this kind of thing,
嗯，它們最初是為小燈這種東西製造的，

12:55
and through that form,
i met an electronics engineer, 
he was also a chameleon specialist, his name was andy.
通過那個論壇，我遇到了一個電子工程師，他也是變色龍專家，他叫安迪。

13:00
beveridge and two other friends, rob lane and rachel hitch，
貝弗里奇和另外兩個朋友，羅布·萊恩和瑞秋·希奇， 

13:06
and we imported with a great deal of difficulty, 
the first centimeters into the uk
我們非常困難地將第一個 centimeters 進口到英國。

13:12
when I got mine I soon discovered that
當我拿到我的時，我很快發現

13:14
this amazing mercury vapor lamp was indeed amazing, but it was amazingly bad.
這個驚人的汞蒸氣燈確實很驚人，但它是驚人地糟糕。

13:19
and I vowed that i'd test every uvb lamp on sale in the uk
我發誓我要測試每一個在英國發售的 uvb 燈，

13:25
well at that time there were only three manufacturers,
so it didn't seem too big a task.
嗯，當時只有三個廠家，所以這似乎不是一項太大的任務。

13:30
but then this guy named bob mccarter from america on the fort,
但後來這個叫鮑勃·麥克卡特的人，來自美國堡壘，

13:34
through the forum, sent me samples of a new invention the mega ray, 
and all the way from north carolina.
通過論壇，給我寄來了一個新發明的樣本，mega ray，一路從北卡羅來納州。

13:44
he sent them and he sent a ballast as well, 
so I could use the english voltage with the american map.
他也寄了鎮流器，所以我可以在美國燈泡上使用英文電壓。

13:50
and everything got really busy after,
之後一切都變得非常忙碌，

13:51
that, so I guess that's really how I got into looking at reptiles.
所以我想這就是我真正開始研究爬行動物的方式。

13:59
: it's a great story, and I think i'm sure it must have been. 
: 這是一個很棒的故事，我想我確定一定是。

14:01
because he said, you know, 
people were using uv back in the late 90s and mid 90s and whatnot,
因為他說，你知道，人們在 90 年代末和 90 年代中期使用紫外線等等，

14:05
but i'm sure having that experience of measuring that first bulb 
must have just opened up this giant spider web of confusion.
但我敢肯定，測量第一個燈泡的經驗，一定剛剛打開了這個巨大的混亂蜘蛛網。

14:15
and where do we go from here?
我們會從這去到哪裡?

14:17
and so so what did you do next?
那麼接下來你做了什麼？

14:19
once you started testing balls were you like?
一旦你開始測試球，你喜歡嗎？

14:21
: oh right, yeah, well this is yeah,
: 哦 對 對 是的。

14:23
this is really how the uv guide started,
這其實是 uv 指南如何開始的。

14:26
well I had my three new friends,
and I created this website called uv guide in 2005.
好，我有了三個新朋友，我在 2005 年創建了這個名為 uv 指南的網站。

14:34
and I can just show you that, actually, um yeah, 
this is our little website to publish our findings.
我可以給你看，實際上，嗯，是的，
這就是我們發表我們發現的小網站：
![](https://i.imgur.com/cFPitGG.png)

14:40
well unfortunately that 
that little website hasn't been updated for years,
不幸的是，那個小網站多年來一直沒有更新。

14:44
i've just never had time to do it, but that was the beginning,
我只是從來沒有時間這樣做，但這就是開始，

14:47

and andy beveridge then gave me his spectrometer on semi-permanent loan, 
然後安迪貝弗里奇把他的光譜儀半永久借給了我，

14:51
well, i'd never seen a spectrometer,
i didn't know anything about it, but he taught me how to use it.
我從未見過我沒有見過的光譜儀，對此一無所知，但他教會了我如何使用它。

15:00
well... the other two in the group kind of moved on to other things,
然後... 小組中的其他兩個有點轉移到其他事情上，

15:01
but andy and I kept on testing, 
但安迪和我持續測試，

15:03
and we even took the meters and the spectrometer on field trips.
我們甚至在實地考察中帶上了儀表和光譜儀。
 
15:09
and this is us in mindo cloud forest in ecuador
這就是我們在厄瓜多爾的 Mindo 雲霧森林
![](https://i.imgur.com/dqRgm16.jpg)

15:13
and we're taking a spectrum of the light, 
in the in the um in the canopy, under the canopy
我們在樹冠下的樹冠中，在 um 中獲取光譜

15:22
and um it was a wonderful holiday.
嗯，這是一個美妙的假期。

15:24
that was we went to galapagos,
我們去加拉帕戈斯，

15:26
and this is me in nolanji in kakadu in australia
這是我在 澳大利亞 卡卡杜 的 諾蘭吉 
![](https://i.imgur.com/T17OVx6.png)

15:30
and after that, for every holiday I went,
i was an absolute nightmare,
之後，我去的每個假期，我是一個絕對的噩夢，

15:34
because I was forever going stop the car,
when you take a uv lifting every hour.
因為當你要進行每小時一次的紫外線提升時，我永遠要停車。

15:39
so I look at my watch, 
and I say need time to stop for another reason.
我會看著我的手錶，然後說因為另一個原因，需要停下來一下。

15:44
but you know you get you get really excited about these things, well I do。
但你知道你真的對這些事情感到興奮，好吧，我是。

15:47
: and you got to get that data,
: 而你必須得到那些數據，

15:51
and that's the thing is back then, 
it was understood, that you needed to be there,
but there was just no data behind it
原來當時是這樣，可以理解，你必須在那裡，但其實那背後沒有數據

15:57
: right, it was just by your bulb and then that was it.
: 對吧，只有靠你的燈泡。

15:59
: yeah, and of course, in 2006 we got these.
: 是的，當然，在 2006 年我們得到了這些。

16:02
we got the uv index meters which made a huge difference.
我們得到了紫外線指數計，它造成巨大的不同。

16:06
right, um but you know, back to the story, 
if I just um stop that. 
um, well, um,
是的。嗯，但回到故事中，你知道，如果我，嗯，就此停止了...那就..嗯，

association of zoos and aquaria,
安迪向我介紹了英國和愛爾蘭動物園協會和水族館，

16:17
biazer for short and the zoo world

16:21
and zookeeper douglas sheriff who was then at chester zoo 
had been working a lot with uv.
和當時在切斯特動物園的動物園管理員道格拉斯警長一直在研究紫外線。

16:28
when he invited me to present our work 
at my first zookeepers conference 
which was a black pool zoo in 2005.
當他邀請我介紹我們的工作，在我的初次動物園管理員會議上，那是在黑池動物園，2005 年。
 
16:37
um and maybe it wouldn't have gone much further,

16:39
but between 2006 and 2007,

16:43
a lot of the reptile supply companies were jumping on the bandwagon,
許多爬行動物供應公司都趕上潮流，

16:45
and trying to provide ever stronger uvb lamps,
試圖提供更強大的 uvb 燈，


16:51
and there came up a problem with lamps from several of the major manufacturers, um, supplying, 
並且出現了，來自幾家主要製造商，嗯，供應商的燈存在問題。

16:57
they were causing uvb burns to eyes and skin and a horrifying 10 death rate in younger animals,
它們會導致 uvb 灼傷眼睛和皮膚並且在年輕的動物上有高達 10% 的死亡率。

17:03
: wow, 
: no one could work out why,

: 喔，
: 沒有人可以找出原因，

17:07
because the total uvb readings with the uv meters were quite low,
因為用紫外線計測量總 uvb 讀數相當低，

17:12
but there were some amazing people on the forums across the world,
and I started collecting case histories from them,
但是世界各地的論壇上都有一些了不起的人，我開始從他們那裡收集案例歷史，

17:18
and they even sent me samples of the lamps,
他們甚至寄給我燈的樣品，

17:21

right across the pond 
for me to test,

17:39
well with the help of the spectrometer and the uv index meter,
在光譜儀和紫外線指數計的幫助下，

17:41
what I discovered was that they were all emitting unnaturally short wavelengths uvb,
我發現它們都發出不自然的短波長 uvb，

17:48
which isn't found in sunlight, but not uvc, 
but only tiny amounts of this short wavelengths uvb could could burn the eyes.
它在陽光下找不到，也在 uvc 中找不到，
但只有極少量的這種短波 uvb 會灼傷眼睛。

18:10
which was quite amazing really,
真是太神奇了，

18:13
and then other companies started sending me samples to test for them too,
