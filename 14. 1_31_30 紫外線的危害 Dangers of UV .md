:older_woman: yeah.
:older_woman: 是。

:bearded_person: and i think one of the things 
:bearded_person: 我認為其中一件事...
 
91:30
:bearded_person: that happens is now that we're having this very big swing over to uv use,
:bearded_person: 發生，就是我們現在很大的轉向使用紫外線，

91:32
which is great, i think sometimes people forget that
那很好，但我想有時人們會忘記

91:38
uv needs to be provided properly.
紫外線需要正確提供。

91:40
and you can provide too much,
你可能提供太多了，

91:42
or you can set your enclosure up in a way, 
where uv now becomes a danger.
或者您設置圍籠的方式使紫外線變得危險。

91:45
it's not just as simple as 
placing a bulb 
and putting a basking spot under it,
這不是僅僅像「設置一個燈泡並在下面設置曬點」那麼簡單， 

91:49
because you, if, you can get burns, and whatnot,
你可能被燒傷，諸如此類，

91:51
so, what are some of the dangers of using it incorrectly,
那麼，錯誤使用它有哪些危險，

91:55
and how can people make sure they use it safely?
人們如何確保安全使用它？

91:56
:older_woman: that's a good point, yeah, i think we do.
這是一個很好的觀點，是的，我們確實這樣。

91:59
there was a stage where, everybody wanted more and more uv,
曾經有一個階段，每個人都想要越來越多的紫外線，

92:01
and it really caused problems.
而這確實引起了問題。

92:05
um, reptiles and people and all living things,
嗯，爬行動物和人類，所有的生物，

92:09
they've evolved to cope with what they encounter every day, in their environment where they evolved.
他們已經進化到，能應對在他們進化的環境中每天遭遇的事情。

92:15
and not just cope with it, but also thrive with it.
不僅僅是應付它們，也隨著它們茁壯成長。

92:17
so, if we do provide UV,
所以，如果我們要提供紫外線，

92:20
you've got to do it at safe levels.
你必須在安全的水平上做。

92:22
and, that doesn't just mean a natural sunlight spectrum,
這不僅意味著一個自然的陽光光譜，

92:26
it also means not exceeding the sort of levels the species would see in the wild.
這也意味著，不超過該物種在野外看到的那種水平。
  
92:32
and i think the "ferguson zones" can help there, 
我認為 "弗格森區" 可以提供幫助，

92:34
in an understanding that we don't want to blast them with high uv.
在了解到，我們不想用高的紫外線照射他們。 
92:39
but i think one thing that we have to bear in mind is that
但我認為，我們必須牢記的是

92:41
we don't normally vary the uv level during the day,
我們通常不會在白天改變紫外線水平，

92:46
labs`?lamp` come on in the morning, they go off in the evening,
燈在早上亮，他們在晚上熄滅，
 
92:49
and i think, fair enough,
我認為，很合理，

92:51
but what it, we generally say is, is to have a rule,
但是，我們通常說的是，有一個規則，

92:53
is to offer like morning levels of uv,
是提供像早上的紫外線水平。

92:56
because that's when most species bask.
因為那是大多數物種曬太陽的時候。

93:00
rather than the maximum they might get at noon,
而不是他們在中午可能得到的最大值， 

93:03
when actually they're more likely to be sheltering.
他們那時候實際上更有可能躲避。

93:06
and always to pair that uv with the basking lamp, 
並且總是將該紫外線與太陽燈配對，

93:09
so that it's a patch of sunlight,
所以它是一片陽光，

93:12
and this is why if you can afford one,
這就是為什麼如果你能買得起，

93:14
you know, a centimeter`?solarmeter 6.5` six five uv index meter 
你知道的，一個 solarmeter 6.5 的紫外線指數儀

93:17
is really superb for setting up the lamps, monitoring the lifespan of the lamp,
非常適合設置燈具，監控燈具的使用壽命，

93:25
um, and,
嗯 ，然後，

93:27
so, when what can go wrong,
所以，什麼時候會出錯，

93:29
all the major companies like zoomed, zilla, arcadia, 
所有大公司，如 zoomed、zilla、arcadia，

93:32
they're well aware of the risks of getting the spectrum role`?wrong`.
他們都清楚頻譜錯誤的風險。

93:37
um, especially with the non-terrestrial very short wavelengths UVB and uvc,
嗯，特別是對於非陸地的極短波長的 UVB 和 uvc，

93:40
and i don't think they're... 
我不認為他們...

93:41
i think they're very unlikely to come out with anything hazardous, if you follow the recommendations.
我認為如果您遵循建議來使用，他們不太可能出現危險的東西。

93:49
there are still a few lamps out there which are not safe, 
仍然有一些燈不安全，

93:52
mostly they're cheap chinese imports,

93:55
they're sold under a brand name that you might not have heard of,
它們以您可能沒有聽說過的品牌名稱出售，

94:00

一些便宜的熒光燈管和 "省電燈泡(一體式螢光燈)?"

94:02
can have flaws in the phospho coatings

94:04
that let traces of uvc through.
會讓微量的 uvc 通過。

94:09
small halogen bulbs with no front glass,
沒有前玻璃的小鹵素燈泡，

94:12
now they're being sold as all-in-one heat light and uv bulbs on amazon, ebay,
現在它們在 amazon, ebay 上作為多功能加熱燈和紫外線燈泡出售，

94:17
and they're often being sold direct from china.
他們經常直接從中國出售。 

94:20
and they emit a very unnatural spectrum with short wavelength UVB and even uvc in very narrow beams.
它們發出非常不自然的光譜，具有短波長 UVB 甚至 uvc，在一個非常窄光束中。

94:28
they can also reach really dangerously high temperatures as well.
它們也可以達到非常危險的高溫。

94:30
i nearly set fire to my test kit,
我差點燒了我的測試套件，

94:34
because i put them under little blocks,
因為我把它們放在一些小區塊下，

94:37
i have a black a white and a brown block 
我有一個黑色、白色和棕色的區塊，

94:39
for the temperatures at about a foot distance,
用於測試溫度，距離大約在一英尺。

94:42
and the black block went up to in the 90s centigrade, so,
而黑色區塊可以升高到攝氏 90 度，所以，

94:46
it was nearly, it's it's actually smoldering it,
幾乎是，它實際上正在悶燒，
 
94:49
was terrifying, i couldn't believe it, but anyway,
太可怕了，我不敢相信，但是反正，
 
94:53
that was a 50 watt one, it was quite a narrow beam as you can imagine.
那是一個 50 瓦的光束，你可以想像它是一個相當窄的光束。

94:58
but you just have to be really careful,
但你就是必須非常小心，

95:00
because they're selling these as UVB all in one lamps, 
因為他們將這些作為 UVB 多功能 (all in one) 燈出售

95:02
and they're getting, you know, it usually says `?three naught on it`,
他們總是，你知道，它通常說 `?三個沒有`。

95:07
while they've chosen three naught, i have no idea.
他們選擇了 "三個沒有"，我不知道為什麼， 

95:10
um, so, if you avoid those, all those sort of things,
嗯，所以，如果你避免那些，所有那些事情，

95:14
um, and also there's some chinese brand UVB leds that have appeared recently,
嗯，還有一些最近出現的中國品牌 UVB LED，

95:20
um again, they're usually sent from china,
嗯，它們通常是從中國寄來的，

95:23
you you actually order them from the chinese company,
你實際上是從中國公司訂購的， 

95:27
and one or two of them have got dangerous spectra with non-terrestrial UVB, 
並且他們中的一兩個人得到了具有非地球紫外線的危險光譜，

95:31
and serena wunderlich in germany's tested a couple and found them to be quite unpleasant.
德國的 serena wunderlich 對一對燈進行了測試，發現他們非常不愉快。
> 何時測試的? 哪個品牌?

95:38
but if you avoid those, and you use the tried and tested products,
但是，如果您避免使用這些，並且使用久經考驗的產品，

95:42 
i suppose, the real risk is just over exposure of your eyes and your skin.
我想，真正的風險，只是過度暴露你的眼睛和皮膚。

95:45
and i suppose that's just common sense really,
我想這只是常識，

95:47
you need to find out what the minimum safe distances are,
你需要找出最小安全距離是多少， 

95:51
and just don't let the animal get any closer.
只是不要讓動物靠近。 

95:54
and it always provides shade, and shelter from the uv,
記得永遠要提供遮蔽和遮擋紫外線，

95:58
and restrict your sun strength UVB.
並限制你的太陽強度 UVB。

96:01
your morning sun UVB just restrict it to the basking zone, 
早晨太陽的 UVB 只限制在曬點區，

96:03
so that you've got a gradient into shade.
這樣你就有了一個漸變到陰影中。 

96:08
um and the other thing,
嗯，另一件事，

96:10
is don't use those nuts with narrow beams, if you can see nuts with narrow beams,
是不要使用那些小光束，如果你能看到窄光束，

96:11
if you can see that it's only lighting up a small circle,
如果你能看到它只是照亮了一個小圓圈，

96:15
that's smaller than your reptile's body.
比爬行動物的身體還小。

96:18
the UVB can be quite concentrated there,
UVB 可以在那里相當集中，

96:21
i mean metal mercury vapor lamps are really prone to that,
我的意思是金屬汞蒸氣燈很容易出現這種情況，

96:24
you get these little circles, some of them have awfully narrow beams,
你得到這些小圓圈，其中一些有非常窄的光束，

96:28
and the whole animal isn't getting it,
動物不是整個身體都得到，

96:30
it's just like half of its back, so obviously the heating and the lighting is not going to be normal.
例如只照到背的一半，顯然加熱和照明不會正常。

96:36
um but you probably won't see much in the way of damage,
嗯，但你可能不會看到太多的損壞，

96:43
the first sign of overexposures often that photocharacter conjunctivitis.
過度曝光的第一個跡象通常是光性結膜炎。

96:47
there's no blindness in humans. where the little cornea, is so delicate, it's first affected by the uv,
人類沒有失明。小角膜如此嬌嫩，最先受到紫外線的影響，
 
96:54
and it feels like you've got glass in your eye,
感覺就像你的眼睛裡有玻璃，

96:56
which fortunately i've never had, but,
幸運的是我從來沒有，但是，

96:59
um, and the reptiles they huddle with their eyes closed,
嗯，還有他們閉著眼睛擠成一團的爬行動物，

97:01
it's just awful imagining the pain that it is,
想像它的痛苦真是太可怕了，

97:04
and sometimes if it's severe that little eyelids swell up too,
有時如果嚴重的話小眼瞼也會腫起來，

97:10
and, back in you know back in 2005, 2006, was quite a few,
而且，早在 2005 年、2006 年，你就知道有很多，

97:14
and and but if you remove the lamp, the healing is really quick,
但是如果你把燈拿掉，癒合真的很快，
 
97:19
because the cornea regenerates really fast, 
因為角膜再生非常快，

97:20
it can only take two or three days,
只需要兩三天，

97:22
even three or four days,
甚至三四天，

97:24
and the eyes open again, and they're fine.
眼睛再次睜開，一切都很好。

97:28
you can get skin sunburns, um they're just blisters,
你可以得到皮膚曬傷，嗯，他們只是水泡，

97:31
like it does with us, like thermal burns, 
就像它對我們所做的那樣，就像熱灼傷，

97:34
um if it's chronic, it can cause like an abnormal shedding with damaged skin,
嗯，如果它是慢性的，它可能會導致皮膚受損的異常脫落，

97:39
usually on the back or the shoulders.
通常在背部或肩部。

97:43
and if it's very chronic exposure, you can get prolonged skin damage,
如果它是非常長期的暴露，你可能會受到長期的皮膚損傷，

97:48
and, although reptiles are very resistant to skin cancer, compared to mammals,
而且，雖然爬行動物對皮膚癌有很強的抵抗力，但與哺乳動物相比，

97:55
you can get, um, you can end up with with some of the skin cancer,
你可以得到，嗯，你最終可能會患上一些皮膚癌，

98:01
but it's very unusual.
但這很不常見。

98:04
um, uh, the other thing is people often ask
嗯，嗯，另一件事是人們經常問

98:06
whether too much uv can cause too much vitamin d, enough to cause toxicity?
是否過多的紫外線會導致過多的維生素 D，足以引起毒性？

98:12
and it's quite widely known now, that if it doesn't happen in natural sunlight.
現在廣為人知的是，如果它不會發生在自然陽光下。
 
98:16
because there's a natural buffering system in the presence of strong sunlight.
因為在強烈陽光下存在自然緩衝系統。
 
98:21
other photo products form as well as the pre D3,
其他照片產品會像 pre D3 一樣形成，
 
98:25
and also once it's formed into D3 the xsd3 is actually broken down by sunlight if it's not been taken into the body.
而且一旦它形成 D3，如果 xsd3 沒有被吸收到體內，它實際上會被陽光分解。

98:34
but it does require a spectrum similar to sunlight.
但它確實需要類似於陽光的光譜。

98:36
a continuous spectrum in the UVB, and up into the uva,
UVB 中的連續光譜，一直到 uva，

98:42
and some of the new lamps including some of the prototype UVB leds,
還有一些新燈，包括一些原型 UVB LED，
 
98:48
actually, they don't have that type of spectrum,
實際上，他們沒有那種類型的頻譜，

98:50
they have little spikes, where they think there's going to be really good D3 forming,
他們認為會有非常好的 D3 形成的地方有小尖峰，

98:53
they're more like D3 drug producing lamps.
它們更像是 D3 制毒燈。

99:01
and theoretically, it's only theoretical,
從理論上講，這只是理論上的，

99:05
the buffering system could be compromised,
緩衝系統可能會受到損害，

99:08
and you could get excess D3, but the thing is we've no idea,
你可以得到多餘的d3，但問題是我們不知道，

99:12
if that's actually going to occur, or if it will occur,
這是否真的會發生，或者如果它發生，


99:17
how long it would take, whether to be a build up, 
需要多長時間，是否會堆積，

99:19
or whether the body would just excrete it,
或者身體是否會排泄，

99:21
you know, like it normally does it breaks down excess passes it out in in the urine and in the faeces,
你知道的，就像它通常做的那樣，它會分解多餘的物質，通過尿液和糞便排出，

99:28
but we don't know, we just don't know, and,
但我們不知道，我們就是不知道，而且，

99:30
and i think i'd like to see a lot more research on long-term exposure.
我想我希望看到更多關於長期暴露的研究。

99:33
um, no one's done the blood testing.
嗯，沒有人做過血液測試。

99:36
which is what what you need, and blood testing is expensive.
這就是您所需要的，而且驗血很昂貴。

99:40
it's going to be quite difficult to get it done.
完成它將非常困難。

99:43
:bearded_person: yeah, yeah, and i mean that's the nature of new technology developing,
是的，是的，我的意思是這就是新技術發展的本質，

99:46
we there's going to be always holes in the knowledge until we kind of understand how certain things work. 
在我們了解某些事情是如何運作的之前，我們的知識總是會存在漏洞。
 
99:52
and, so, i think at the end of the day,
所以，我認為在最終，

99:54
if you follow the you know, stick with the normal brands the usual reptile brands, follow the packaging.
如果您遵循您知道的，請堅持使用大眾品牌，普遍的爬行動物品牌，遵循包裝。

99:58
if you don't have a solar meter,
如果你沒有太陽能計，

99:59
make sure the distance is whatever the package says, and provide shade.
確保距離與包裝上說的一樣，並提供遮蔭。

100:02
you can be pretty sure that 
你可以很確定

100:04
you're providing safe amounts of uv.
你提供了安全量的紫外線。

100:08
yes, excellent well dr baines...
是的，很好，貝恩斯博士...
