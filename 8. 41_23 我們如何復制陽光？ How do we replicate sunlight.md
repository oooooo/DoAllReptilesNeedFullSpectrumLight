---
41:23  
:bearded_person: so as far as replicating the sunlight goes
:bearded_person: 就複製陽光而言

41:25
how, how do we do this? 
what, as far as right now?
我們如何做到這一點？ 到目前為止做到的？

41:28
because even listening to you talking about,
因為即使聽你說，

41:29
you know the different levels of visible light,
你知道可見光有不同級別，

41:30
someone could go to the dollar store and buy a cheap led bulb, 
有人可以去一元店買一個便宜的 led 燈泡，


41:35
and who knows what that light is giving off of,
誰知道那光發出了什麼，

41:36
and then, who knows what result that it's doing to your animal.
然後誰知道它對你的動物有什麼結果。

41:40
so, what is the best best method for attempting to do this，
那麼，嘗試這樣做的最佳方法是什麼。

41:42
where the technology is right now?
現在的技術在哪裡？

41:46
:older_woman: well i think it was originally everyone wanted to get an all-in-one bulb,
:older_woman: 好吧，我想最初是每個人都想要一個多合一燈泡，

41:49
it was like the holy grail, wasn't it?
這就像聖杯，不是嗎？

41:51
that you'd have an all-in-one that would do uv heat and light
你不是有一個可以做紫外線的多合一熱和光

41:57
but our current attempts haven't been very successful,
但我們目前的嘗試並不是很成功，

41:59
and i think it'll be a long time,
before we can offer a really good sunlight simulator.
我認為，我們還需要很長時間，才能提供一個真正好的陽光模擬器。

42:06
i think our current mix and match solutions
我認為我們目前的混合配套解決方案

42:08
are probably even better than a single lap, would be too,
可能甚至比單圈還要好，也是如此，

42:12
because then we can blend different spectrum,
因為這樣我們就可以混合不同的光譜，

42:13
we can vary the intensities of each,
我們可以改變個別的強度，

42:15
so they give us more flexibility,
所以他們給了我們更大的靈活性，

42:19
and they give us more control,
and i, i think i can show you, what i mean showing you the different spectra.
他們給了我們更多的控制權，
我想我可以向你展示，
我的意思是向你展示不同的光譜。

42:25
because people don't really, don't really often see this,
因為人們並不真的，不經常看到這一點，

42:27
so and i think it's it's really interesting.
我認為這真的很有趣。

42:29
so, here's our solar spectrum and this is really the holy grail.
所以，這是我們的太陽光譜，這是，真的是聖杯。
![](https://i.imgur.com/GYajXTa.png)

42:36
so, to start with let's look at the part with the uvb and the visible light, so,
所以首先讓我們看一下帶有 uvb 和可見光的部分，

42:41
it's this part here...
是這個部分...
![](https://i.imgur.com/wruKDGd.png)

42:45
the first all-in-one bulbs that provide uvb uv uva visible light and infrared were mercury vapor lamps
第一個能提供 uvb uva 可見光和紅外線的多合一燈泡是汞蒸氣燈。

42:54
so if we have a look at that
所以如果我們看一看

42:56
this is the sunlight,
這是陽光，
this is just the spec the part with the sunlight,
up to the end of the red spectrum, that we can see...
這只是陽光的部分規格，
截在到紅色光譜末端。我們可以看到...
![](https://i.imgur.com/7D1qb4M.png)

43:03
if we put the mercury vapor light on it,
如果我們把水銀蒸氣燈的光譜放在上面，
![MegaRay 160w spectrum](https://i.imgur.com/mct60a1.png)

43:05
you can see that it looks terrible doesn’t it?
你可以看到它看起來很糟糕對吧？

43:07
:bearded_person: yes it does
:bearded_person: 是的 的確 

:older_woman: it’s just a few spikes, that’s absolutely typical mercury vapor lamp, they’re all like that,
:older_woman: 只有幾個峰值，那絕對是典型的汞蒸氣燈，它們都是像那樣，

43:14
exactly virtually exactly the same.
幾乎完全一樣。

43:17
because that's how much your (mercury) vapor works
因為這就是你的汞蒸氣燈的作用。

43:19
and you've got the light, looks a bit green to us
這種光，我們看起來有點綠，

43:21
and it renders colors really badly, 
because our eyes have to kind of work out in our brains,
它渲染的顏色非常糟糕，
因為我們的眼睛有點像在我們的大腦中工作，

43:27 
what those spikes are going to look out look like, in the, in the wild,
那些尖峰看起來會是什麼樣子，在野外。

43:31
we have no idea what that looks like to a reptile.
我們不知道爬行動物看起來像什麼。

43:33
:bearded_person: right

43:35
:older_woman: and it's spiky even in the uv range,
即使在紫外線範圍內也很尖

43:39
and it can't be dimmed,
it can't be thermostatically controlled,
並且不能變暗，它不能被恆溫控制，

43:41
and the other problem with mercury vapor is that...
汞蒸氣的另一個問題是...

43:44
they have very narrow beams, so many brands do anyway, so it only covers like a small circle.
他們是很窄的光束。
反正很多品牌都是這樣，總之，所以它只涵蓋了一個小圓圈。

43:51
and it's the other problem which is actually the biggest problem probably,
還有另一個問題，實際上可能是最大的問題，

43:52
is that many brands are impossible to
make with a consistent output,
是很多品牌做不到一致的輸出製作。

43:57 
這樣你就可以
so you can get two identical bulbs in identical boxes, 
所以你可以拿兩個一樣的燈泡從一樣的盒子裡，

44:02
you take them out and you test them,
你把它們拿出來測試，

44:04
and they're giving totally different amounts of uvb.
他們提供了完全不同數量的 uvb。

44:09
well so, 
they they saved thousands of animals, 
當然，他們拯救了成千上萬的動物，

44:13
and you know, they've been wonderful lamps, 
but there are now much better things,  i think.
而且你知道，它們曾經是很棒的燈，
但我認為現在有更好的，我想。

44:18
well, the successes in human lighting situations were **metal halides**
嗯，在人類照明情況下的成功是**金屬鹵化物**燈
![](https://i.imgur.com/FbrFE79.png)

44:23
and you can see straight away, 
there's a good metal halide for humans, like this phillips one.
你可以直接看到，有一種對人類很好的金屬鹵化物燈，就像這個 phillips 一樣。

44:24
you've got a much more realistic looking solar spectrum,
really, it sort of mirrors, it almost.
你有一個更逼真的太陽光譜，
真的有點像鏡子

44:32
you've got masses of uva,
你有大量的 uva，

44:34
you've got quite a lot of all the colors in a continuous spectrum.
在一個連續的光譜中，你有很多顏色。

44:40
it's spiky, 
because there are lots of different chemicals involved.
尖尖的，
因為涉及到很多不同的化學物質。

44:44
but it adds up to quite a good a good spectrum.
但它加起來是一個很好的頻譜。

44:48
and in europe they're very widely used over bavarians`?`.
在歐洲，它們被廣泛用於巴伐利亞人。

44:51
um they have an extremely bright clean white light.
嗯，它們有非常明亮乾淨的白光。

44:56
and i think they're probably the best some assimilator,
我認為他們可能是最好的一些同化者

44:57
in the visible range.
在可見範圍內

45:00
and you can get versions now, 
with uvb for reptiles.
您現在可以有很多版本的 uvb 用於爬行動物，

and in the USA, 
zoo med, exo-terra have versions,
而在美國， zoo med, exo-terra 也有一些版本，

45:06
and in europe, there are a lot of brands,
and in fact,
在歐洲有很多品牌，事實上，

45:12
there's even a mega ray in europe 
which which is a metal halide.
歐洲甚至有一種 mega ray 是金屬鹵化燈。

45:15
and you can see now,
it's producing uv uh uvb as well.
你現在可以看到，
它也產生紫外線，呃紫外線 B。
![](https://i.imgur.com/As1vD3F.png)

45:23
um but they've never been possible really to to get them popular in the UK or the USA,
嗯，但他們從沒能真正在英國或美國受歡迎，

45:27
and i think it's probably because they need external ballasts.
我認為可能是因為他們需要外部鎮流器。

45:33
also they're like mercury vapors, they can't be dimmed,
他們也像汞蒸氣燈一樣，不能調暗，

45:34
they can't put on a thermostat,
他們不能加裝恆溫器；

45:37
and they have the same problem, they vary a lot in their uvb output.
他們有同樣的問題，他們的 uvb 輸出差異很大，

45:39
they tend to have narrow beams.
他們往往是窄的光束；

45:44
and the ones designed for reptiles, tend to lose their uvb fairly rapidly.
而這種為爬行動物設計的，往往相當迅速地失去他們的 uvb；

45:50
but they do keep their visible light for years,
但它們的確保持可見光很多年，

45:52
and i've used mine for their visible light, long after the uvb has gone,
我已經使用我的可見光很久，在它 uvb 消失之後，

45:57
and i use other lamps for uvb next to them.
我在它們 (之後`?旁邊`) 使用其他的 uvb 燈 。

46:00
:bearded_person: i'm sort of surprised at how limited the infrared is from those bulbs.
:bearded_person: 我有點驚訝這些燈泡的紅外線是多麼有限。

46:05
:older_woman: yeah well, metal halides are designed to produce much much more in the visible light than in the infrared.
:older_woman: 是的，金屬鹵化物燈的設計目的，就是在可見光段產出比在紅外線段中更多。

46:13
and in fact the visible light is what heats is what heats the animal which is much more than the infrared.
事實上，可見光比紅外線更能加熱動物 (`可見光是 "加熱動物的熱" 遠勝紅外線`)。

46:20
:bearded_person: gotcha. 
:bearded_person: 了解.
:older_woman: they still have quite spiky uv, um,
:older_woman: 發現他們仍然有相當尖銳的紫外線，嗯，

46:25
because the halides they use for the uvb ones are not quite as well defined as the ones they use for human lighting.
因為他們 "用於 uvb 的" 滷化物，不像 "用於人類照明的" 那樣明確。

46:33
but i think, if you're looking at the uvb range, they're still spiky in uvb,
但我想如果你在看 uvb，它們在 uvb 中仍然很尖，

46:35
and i think the lamps which create the best in the uvb range, are the fluorescent tubes,
我認為在 uvb 範圍內產生最好的燈，是熒光燈管。
![](https://i.imgur.com/OYAJy2y.png)

46:43 
and you can see if you look at this uvb part,
你可以看看，如果你看這個 uvb 部分，

46:45
it matches the solar spectrum pretty well.
它與太陽光譜非常匹配。

46:49
up to the boundary of uvb that really is very nice.
達到 uvb 的邊界，這真的非常好；

46:54
but of course the visible light is discontinuous, and it's not very bright either.
但，可見光是不連續的，而且也不是很亮。

46:59
as we know from uv tubes not being particularly bright,
正如我們從 UV 管了解的，不是特別亮，

47:04
they use a phosphor and a borosilicate glass 
他們使用磷光體和硼矽酸鹽玻璃

47:06
to create that smooth increase in uvb 
with increasing wavelengths.
來創造隨著波長增加而滑順增加的 uvb。

47:13
so, if we used an incandescent lamp,
如果我們使用白熾，

47:16
which is like a halogen flood or an incandescent flood, which will work like that.
像鹵素泛光燈或白熾泛光燈，將會像白熾燈那樣工作。
![](https://i.imgur.com/L7wawF1.png)

47:20
which looks like that, 
you've got a little bit of uva,
看起來像那樣，你有一點 uva，

47:25
and then gradually increasing with the increasing temperature,
然後隨著溫度的升高逐漸增加，

47:27
you're getting increasing in red light,
你在紅燈下越來越多，

47:30
so, you can blend those two,
and you can supplement the missing red and infrared really well,
所以，你可以混合這兩者，
你可以很好地補充缺失的紅色和紅外線，

47:35
and you can add some of the other colors too, so you can make a blend, and, 
你也可以添加一些其他顏色，這樣你就可以混合，並且，
 
47:41
you can make quite a natural looking light,
你可以製作出非常自然的光線，

47:43
now, you saw blue earlier on, and,
現在, 你剛剛看到的小藍 (那隻小傢伙)，

47:45
this is his lighting array under his basking zone,
這是他曬太陽區下的照明排列，
![](https://i.imgur.com/ohuLvSU.png)

47:50
and i use that blend quite a lot. 
it's um, there's a t5 high output,
我經常使用這種混合。
這是嗯，有一個t5高輸出，

47:55
um at the top, then there's a metal halide, 
嗯在頂部然後有一個金屬鹵化物，

47:58
and there's an incandescent flood lamp.
和白熾泛光燈。

48:02
and blue looking a bit curious.
小藍看起來有點好奇。

48:05
and recently, i was messing about with spectrometer down at ron murray's, 
and i took the spectrum from the combo in his setup.
最近，我正在亂搞 ron murray 的光譜儀
我從他的設置的組合中獲取了頻譜。

48:13
and you can have a look at that, it's there, and you can see,
你可以看看，在那裏，你可以看到，
![](https://i.imgur.com/KsO6tPD.png)

48:16
it's also a t5 high output,
它也是一個 t5 高輸出

48:21
it's also a halide, and a incandescent lamp,
它也是一個鹵化物，一個白熾燈，

48:25
and so it's filled out the spectrum,
所以它填滿了光譜，

48:27
you've still got the uvb down here, 
在這你仍然有紫外線，

48:30
you've still got a massive flood of visible light,
你仍然有大量的可見光，

48:32
and you've got a build up of the infrared which as you pointed out on the, on the lamp on its own,
你已經積累了紅外線，正如你所指出的，在燈本身，
  
48:38
is it fades off down here, but here you've got quite a decent amount of infrared, 
是不是在這裡淡了下來，但在這裡你有相當多的紅外線， 

48:42
so that really is quite nice.
所以真的很不錯。

48:46
and of course, it's got lots of uva, which is which is also very nice. 
當然，它有很多 uva，這也很好。

48:51
now people always say well what about using leds instead.
現在總有人說，好，如果用 LED 代替。

48:53
so that's that's a spectrum of an absolutely typical white led.
使用 LED 代替，這是一個絕對典型的白色光譜。
![](https://i.imgur.com/MYKJbb1.png)

48:58
they use a blue led a blue single colored led to drive a phosphor which emits the rest of the light.
他們使用藍色 LED 藍色單色 LED 驅動熒光粉，發出其余光。

49:07
and as you can see,
there's some big gaps,
正如你所看到的，有一些很大的差距

49:09
there is no uva whatsoever, no uvb,
沒有 uva，沒有 uvb。

49:12
there's a kind of a dip, 
here with very little of the turquoise.
這裡 (藍綠間) 有一種傾角，很少的綠松色。

49:14
and of course, it runs off into the into the red.
當然，它進入紅色。

49:20
so, you could work that, 
you could put that into with with rom's combination with the t5 for the uvb and the halogen,
你可以把它 (LED) 與 rom 與 t5 的組合用於 uvb 和鹵素，

49:28
and what you get is that,
你得到的是，
![](https://i.imgur.com/qKkAee2.png)


49:31
which you've now got a very nice uvb,
你現在有一個非常好的 uvb，

49:34
you've got very nice visible light lots of infrared,
你有非常好的可見光大量紅外線，

49:39
but you've got still got this big hole here,
但你還有這個大洞在這裡，

49:40
and i think that's the obvious gap,
我認為這是明顯的差距，

49:43
but again, you know it's it's it's getting there isn't it. 
但，你知道，它正在到達那裡不是嗎。

49:48
so, people suggest using combinations of lamps, the only trouble is,
所以，人們建議使用燈的組合，唯一的麻煩是，
 
49:52
you end up with this huge clutter of
domes and tubes and cables, all balanced together.
你最終會得到這個巨大的混亂，圓頂、管子和電纜都平衡在一起的混亂。

49:59
and i can quite understand people going...
我很能理解人們會...

50:01
oh, i can't cope with all these lamps.
哦，我無法應付所有這些燈。

50:04
um and, there isn't really an easy solution.
嗯，真的不是容易的解決方案。

50:07
but, my bias group worked hard on this,
但，我的 bias 小組為此努力，

50:09
and two years ago, two members of rogue,
在兩年前，兩個 rogue 成員，

50:14
jack baldwood and adam trimmings, at berkshire college of agriculture.
在伯克希爾農業學院的 傑克‧鮑德溫 和 亞當‧催明斯。 

50:19
now they constructed a really neat, all-in-one fixture, and they look like that:
現在，他們建造了一個非常整潔的一體式裝置，它們看起來像那樣：
![](https://i.imgur.com/6WpBiTU.png)

50:26
and it held two incandescent lamps...
它有兩個白熾燈...

50:28
:bearded_person: yeah, 
:bearded_person: 是的，
:older_woman: two incandescent lamps and two t5,
:older_woman: 兩個白熾燈和兩個 t5，

50:31
high output tubes inside a metal frame,
金屬框架內的高輸出管，

50:33
and it's a sort of plug-and-play basking zone,
這是一種即插即用的曬太陽區，

50:37
and this design was taken up by the uk company arcadia,
這個設計被英國阿卡迪亞公司採用。

50:41
and i've got special permission to tell you this, 
我得到了特別許可，可以告訴你這一點，

50:43
the units are now being made commercially,
這個裝置現在正在商業化生產，

50:45
and i had a flyer announcing their launch just last week.
上週我有一張傳單宣布他們的發布。

50:50
and they're going to call them thermal zoo pro,
他們叫它 "thermal`上升熱氣流` zoo pro"。

50:51
they're about two foot long so you could put them at one end of a large enclosure or a large tank
它們大約兩英尺 (約 60cm) 長，
所以你可以把它們放在一個大外殼或大水箱的一端。

50:57
and you can shop and change what lamps you could put in them,
你可以購買和更換你可以放入的燈，

50:59
you could put an led in one or you could put a heat projector in one.
你可以把一個 LED 放在一個里面，
或者你可以把一個 DHP 深熱投影儀放在里面。


51:04
so, we're getting there, um, 
所以，我們正到達那裏，嗯，

51:05
the technology is getting there,
技術正在實現，

51:07
and the understanding of the basking zone is getting there,
並且對曬太陽區的了解正在到達那裡，

51:10
i'm sure other companies will come up with something similar to and, um,
我相信其他公司會想出類似的東西，嗯。

51:17
we're sort of improving all the time,
我們一直在改進，

51:21
and i think that's sort of where i'm at,
from that point of view 
of getting different spectra, 
getting going.
我想我的位置大概是在這裡，
從這個角度來看 -- -- 獲得不同光譜開始。

51:25
: well, i think that design that you just showed at the end there is nice,
好吧，我認為你在最後展示的那個設計很好，

51:29
because one of the challenges i have, 
因為我面臨的挑戰之一，

51:31
depending on the basking height is, 
is getting that blend`?`
取決於曬太陽的高度，正在 ?混合
 
51:35
right? when you have a dome sitting next to a t5,
是吧？ 當你 t5 旁邊有一個圓頂，

51:36
and, if, if you don't have enough height to have them blend down onto a basking patch.
如果你沒有足夠的高度讓它們融合到曬太陽的補丁上`???(燈具體積高度不同不好整理？)`。

51:41
it's just it's sort of　like sectional 
它只是有點像截面

51:43
so that that's another challenge as well 
所以這也是另一個挑戰

51:45
:older_woman: yeah it is.
:older_woman: 對，的確。

51:47
:bearded_person: yeah, so what about, we've sort of mentioned a little bit of infrared, so..
:bearded_person: 是的，那麼，我們已經提到了一點紅外線，所以...
