54:41
which we all go looking for snakes on, that kind of warmth,
我們都去那裏找蛇，那種溫暖，

54:47
so, that's that's producing that kind of heat.
它的產出就是那種熱。

54:49
it's not basking heat at all, 
it's it's environmental,
他們完全不是曬太陽的熱，
他們是環境的熱，
:bearded_person: yeah.
:bearded_person: 是， 
:older_woman: they're very good for that very very good for that.
:older_woman: 作為那樣他們非常好，非常非常好。

54:56
:bearded_person: so then as far as the spectrum goes,
:bearded_person: 那麼就頻譜而言，

54:58
as you kind of alluded to every piece of the spectrum does something different,
正如你所提到的，頻譜的每一部分都做了不同的事情，

55:02
some of some of the spectrum we probably have no idea yet,
一些我們可能還不知道的頻譜，
55:04
we're still looking at those things.
我們還在研究那些東西。

55:05
so can you briefly kind of run through,
那些事情你能不能簡單說一下，

55:07
what we're looking at, as far as what each section of the spectrum do,
我們正在研究的內容，就頻譜的每個部分，所做的而言，

55:11 
and then maybe we'll get a little bit more into detail.
然後也許我們會得到更多細節。

55:12
:older_woman: yeah, sure, 
if we start off with our long long wavelengths we've just gone through... 
是的，如果我們從我們剛剛講過的長波長開始...

<!-- 治癒之光 -->

55:17
we've got our infrared and our red light,
我們有紅外線和紅光，
 
55:20
and they actually penetrate the body of an animal quite quite well,
它們實際上很好地穿透了動物的身體，

55:25
particularly the short wavelengths infrared that will penetrate right through.
特別是短波長的紅外線，會穿透。 

55:30
um, I think we've pretty much covered that, um。
嗯，我想我們已經講得差不多，嗯。

55:35
but also red and infrared a have biological effects, it's not just warmth.
此外紅光和紅外線具有生物學效應，不僅僅是溫暖。
![](https://i.imgur.com/HxBl5TT.png)

55:39
and I think, that's something we tend to completely forget,
我認為，我們往往會完全忘記這件事， 

55:41
we tend to forget that isn't just heating when things are thermoregulating.
我們往往忘記，當溫度調節的時候，它不僅僅是加熱。
 

55:47
because red and infrared actually work on cells,
因為紅光和紅外線實際上對細胞起作用，

55:51
and they work on an enzyme called cytochrome c oxidase, which is in skin cells.
他們對一種叫做細胞色素 c 氧化酶的酶啟作用，位於˙在皮膚細胞。

55:55 
and it actually up regulates over 100 genes.
它實際上向上調節了 100 多個基因。

55:58
and they're very important for things like controlling cell growth and wound healing.
它們對於像控制細胞生長，和傷口癒合之類等的事非常重要。

56:07
they change the way the immune system works,
它們改變了免疫系統的工作方式，

56:09 
they promote the immune system for protecting against things, like uva damage,
它們促進免疫系統抵禦 uva 損傷之類的東西，

56:14 
in fact, so, um, 
it's a sort of a healing light.
事實上，所以，嗯，
這是一種治愈之光。

56:18
people talk about infrared as being a healing light 
人們說紅外線是一種治愈之光

56:20
and it really is.
它真的是。

56:23
and it's used a lot in in medical technology,
它在醫療技術中被大量使用，

56:25
using low level lasers and things like that. 
使用低強度雷射之類的東西。

56:31
um, but, I think it's one of the reasons why wild animals heal up so well in the wild.
嗯，我認為這是為什麼野生動物在野外恢復得這麼好的原因之一，

56:35
and you know, they're using this this natural light for heating.
你知道，他們正在使用這種自然光來加熱。

<!-- 視覺感知 -->

56:42
and we move down the spectrum a bit 
to
我們將頻譜向下移動一點到... 

56:44
our visible light, visible perception.
我們的可見光，視覺感知。
![](https://i.imgur.com/Xn3xwI2.png)

56:47
and, we have to think about the way the reptile eyes work.
我們必須考慮爬行動物眼睛的工作方式。
![](https://i.imgur.com/58A7TFB.png)

56:52
our eyes have got three cones, 
and we've got three cones that
我們的眼睛有三個錐體，在我們的視網膜後，

56:55
that respond to different colors in the back of our retina.
有三個錐體可以對不同顏色做出反應。

57:01
and there's a blue cone,
well they say blue,
有一個藍錐體，他們說是藍，

57:02
it's responding most to blue light,
它對藍光的反應最大；

57:04
one that responds most to green light,
一種對綠光反應最大；

57:06
and one that responds to sort of orange and red.
和一種對橙色和紅色有反應。

57:11
and we decide what color a thing is by the way the they overlap.
然後我們判斷事物的顏色是透過他們的反應交疊。

57:16
if the brain sees a mixture of ,um,
如果大腦看到一個混和反應，嗯，

57:22
this particular amount of the green stimulation with the same amount of red,
一個特定數量的綠色刺激與等量的紅色，

57:26
we go oh it's a red color.
我們會說，哦，它是紅色 (`?黃色`) 的。

57:28 
and that's how we determine color vision.
這就是我們如何確定色覺。

57:31
well reptiles are slightly different,
and different species of reptiles are different as well.
爬行動物略有不同，
不同種類的爬行動物也是不同的。
![](https://i.imgur.com/c2UcUFS.png)

57:37
so, if we take say the turtle it's got,
所以，如果我們假設烏龜有相同的三個錐體，藍綠色和紅，

57:41
but it's got a fourth cone, which is response responsive to uva.
但它有第四個錐體，對 uva 有反應。

57:46
so, this turtle has a very wide range of colour vision,
所以，這只烏龜的色覺範圍很廣，

57:48
right through from uva,
right through to the borderlines of infrared. 
從 uva 開始，一直到紅外線的邊界。

57:54
so it's actually got...
所以祂實際上可以...

57:56
i feel like it's got wider color vision than humans have.
我覺得它比人類有更廣泛的色覺。

57:59
um, so, you know, full possibilities of full color vision.
嗯，所以，你知道，全色視覺充分的可能性。

58:03
there, you can definitely see red
那裡(紅外線處)，你絕對看得到紅色。

58:07
um, but if we look at other species,
they can vary, geckos for example.
嗯，但如果我們看看其他物種，例如壁虎。
![](https://i.imgur.com/KllTVhj.png)

58:12
light in twilight is mainly from
暮光中的光線主要來自

58:15
after the sun has gone down completely,
在太陽完全下山之後，

58:17
it's mainly from diffused light in the sky.
它主要來自天空中的漫射光。

58:20
so you get more of a blue under the uva light,
所以在 uva 段你会得到更多的蓝色。
 
58:24
because that's what's um reflected in the sky.
因為那是反映在天空中的東西，

58:26
as it does, it gets darker.
當如此，它變得更暗。

58:29
so they have very very good vision in that range of light, 
所以祂們在那個光線範圍內有非常非常好的視力，

58:32
they can differentiate.
祂們可以區分。


58:35
because all three of their cones will register into the blue and infrared, un, into uva rather.
因為祂們的三個視錐細胞都會有反應，在藍光波段和紅外線，呃，是 UVA 中。 

58:43
so, you get very very good color discrimination in that type of wavelengths.
所以，在那種類型的波長中你會有非常好的顏色辨別力。
 
58:48
they can see into red, 
祂們可以看到紅色，

58:50
but they can't necessarily discriminate much color there.
但祂們不一定能在那裏區分多少顏色。
 
58:54
if we look at snakes, again, they vary hugely.
如果我們看蛇，在次地，祂們的差別很大。
![](https://i.imgur.com/uVc6Fal.png)

58:57
garter snakes don't have any night vision rods,
吊襪帶蛇沒有夜視桿細胞，

59:03
they only have cones, so their best vision is in daylight,
祂們只有視錐細胞，所以祂們最好的視力是在白天，

59:06
and again, they've got very good vision in uva,
一樣的，祂們在 uva 中有非常好的視力，

59:11
and right through to red, 
so they've got good color vision,
直到紅色，所以祂們有很好的色覺。

59:13
which is why some of them 
這就是為什麼祂們有些
59:15
are very highly colored as well.
顏色很鮮豔的原因。

59:17
but if we look at things like the boa,
如果我們看看像蟒蛇這樣的，
![](https://i.imgur.com/KhypRZ4.png)

59:19
which is the most technical maternalactivity.
這是最具技術性的母性活動。

59:23
that has a very reduced, it only has two two colour cones,
它減少很多，祂只有兩個兩個色錐，

59:25
it's also got a good number of rods for night vision,
但祂有很多夜視桿，
 
59:31
which have a sensitivity somewhere in the in the blue green,
所以在藍綠色的某處具有敏感度，

59:35
so that can see very well,
所以祂們可以看得很清楚，

59:38
you can see very well in dusk, because it's got the uva and it uses the rods for that. 
你在黃昏時可以看得很清楚，因為祂有 uva 和幹細胞都用於那裏。

59:41
and it can also see some of the greens and reds,
祂也可以看到一些綠色和紅色，

59:44
but probably it's colorblind in in that
但可能是色盲，

59:49
sense it's like red green color blind.
感覺就像紅綠色盲。

59:51
but you've got a huge range of different colors 
但是你有各種各樣的顏色，

59:54
that animals can see, or not see, or determine what the color specifically what the color is, 
動物可以看到，或者看不到，或者判斷顏色具體是什麼顏色，

59:59
they can see the light,
他們能看到光,

60:01
but they don't know what anticipate what color it is.
但他們不知道期待什麼，它是什麼顏色，

60:04
so we have to be a bit careful when we provide lighting,
所以我們在提供照明時要小心一點，

60:06
we really need to provide a full spectrum sunlight,
我們真的需要提供全光譜的陽光，

60:07
because that's what it's evolved to use.
因為這就是祂們進化而來使用的。

`(之前有講到，爬蟲類，變溫動物，他們使用的能量一大部分是依賴外部環境，和我們恆溫動物不同)`
 
60:11
and if we change the colors and alter them, then the animals are losing out.
如果我們改變顏色並更改它們，
那麼動物就會受到損失。

60:17
um and it's just my little example,
嗯，這有一個小例子，
![](https://i.imgur.com/7mzNHcj.png)


60:19
there is is people sometimes say to me, 
人們有時對我說，

60:22
well, can I just use red lights for heating and lighting?
嗯，我可以只用紅燈取暖和照明嗎？

60:24
and you think, well, you're wiping out all of its color vision,
你認為，好吧，你正在抹去它所有的色覺，

60:29
um, because everything is either red, or shades of grey or black,
嗯，因為一切都是紅色的，或者灰色或黑色的陰影，

60:34
um and particularly, if it's got any uva reflective parts,
嗯，特別是如果它有任何 uva 反射，

60:36
then you're removing the ability for it to see those as well.
那麼你就刪除了它看到這些的能力。

60:42
so basically, you know full spectrum light is is really important.
所以基本上你知道全光譜光是非常重要的。

60:47
um before we move away from the uva,
嗯，在我們離開 uva 之前，
![](https://i.imgur.com/99YKjDE.png)

60:49
thing everyone goes on,
we don't know much about the uva,
事情每個人都在繼續。
我們對 uva 了解不多，

60:51
we don't measure it.
很多關於 uva 我們不測量它

60:53
um but it also does have biological effects.
嗯，但它也有生物效應。

60:55
um it it increases nitric oxide in the skin,
嗯它會增加皮膚中的一氧化氮，

61:01
it's a defense reaction, that increases vasodilation, 
這是一種防禦反應，會增加血管舒張，

61:03
it makes the blood supply better, and it also lowers the blood pressure,
它使血液供應更好，也降低了血壓，

61:06
so there are there are things that we don't know much about which could be quite important.
所以有些事情我們不太了解，但可能非常重要。

<!-- 非視覺感知 -->

61:14
um but before we move away from visible light all together, 
嗯，但在我們離開可見光之前，

61:17
i think we should just talk a little bit about this non-visual perception.
我認為我們應該談一點這種非視覺感知。

61:20
:bearded_person: because this blows my mind,
:bearded_person: 因為這讓我大吃一驚，

61:22 
when I first read this section of the textbook that you had written a snippet in,
當我第一次在教科書上讀到這一段，你寫了一個片段，

61:27
in and I was just I couldn't believe, this so please go ahead with that.
我簡直不敢相信，所以請繼續。

61:30
:older_woman: yeah this is what what's going on in our brains and in animal brains,
:older_woman: 是的，這就是我們大腦和動物大腦中發生的事情，
![](https://i.imgur.com/rCeKpnq.png)

61:36
that really has only been, only been discovered for, perhaps, 
這真的被發現只有，可能，

61:38
i don't know, 15, 20 years.
我不知道，15、20 年。

61:42
and how it works out is that, we've got different photopigments,

結果是，我們有一些不同的感光色素，
![](https://i.imgur.com/khHGCln.png)
 
61:45 
these are the photopigments that we're very familiar with, 
這些感光色素是我們熟悉的，

61:49
these are our cones, that we see color is.
這些是我們的錐體，我們看到的顏色。

61:52
but also at the back of the retina, in the ganglion cells,
但也在視網膜的後部，在神經節細胞中，
![](https://i.imgur.com/tI7F2Fx.png)

61:55
we've got cells which respond differently, 
我們有不同反應的細胞，
 
61:59
they have a different pigment, it's called melanopsin,
它們有不同的色素，叫做黑視素。

62:02
and it's a non-visual pigment, it doesn't signal to the brain that they can see anything,
它是一種非視覺色素，它不會向大腦發出可以看到任何東西的信號，
 
62:07
but it sends signals to parts of the brain, that responsive for circadian rhythms,
但它會向大腦的某些部分發送信號，對晝夜節律有反應。

62:15
for all that kind of, out of sight, out of mind, responses to light,
對於所有那些看不見的、超乎想像的、對光的反應。

62:21
and it's mostly responsive to blue, it's highly responsive to blue.
它主要對藍色有反應，對藍色有很高的反應。

<!-- 藍光為什麼特別 -->

62:24
everyone goes,
每個人都覺得

62:26
why is it why is it blue?
為什麼是藍色的？

62:28
and it's probably because, blue light is one of the the signals of daytime.
大概是因為，藍光是白天的信號之一。

62:31
when the sky changes from being dark at night to just before dawn,
天空從夜晚變暗到黎明前，

62:40
you get the, um, the diffused the refracted, 
你得到，嗯，擴散的折射，

62:43
what's the right term, scattered.
正確術語是什麼？散射。

62:45
the rally scattering of the sunlight coming up,
即將升起陽光的反彈散射，

62:49
and it comes through as blue and uv,
它以藍色和紫外線的形式出現，

62:52
and so although it's incredibly dim, so you can't really recreate it in a vivarium,
所以儘管，它非常暗淡，你無法真正在動物飼養室中重現它，

62:57
but that incredibly dim blue
light
stimulates these these little cells,
但是那令人難以置信的昏暗藍光刺激了這些小細胞，

63:02
that goes always daytime and that signals to the brain that the dawn is coming.
它總是在白天向大腦發出黎明即將來臨的信號；

63:05
and likewise, the opposite at the other end of the evening.
晚上的另一端也是如此。

<!-- 非視覺感知怎麼發生 -->

63:13
and if I just do this little diagram of this,
我用這張圖說明，

63:15
this is an iguana,
這是一隻鬣蜥，
![](https://i.imgur.com/JtJt171.jpg)

63:17
the light doesn't just go into its eyes,
光不只是進入它的眼睛，

63:20
because reptiles also have these photoresponsive cells with opsins. like melanopsin, 
in other parts of the brain as well.
因為爬行動物也有這些帶有視蛋白的光反應細胞，像黑視素，在大腦其他部分也有。
 
63:28
and, so, the lights going through the lateral eyes, the normal eyes, 
所以光線穿過側眼，正常的眼睛，

63:32
it's also going through, for the species that have got them, through the parietal eye,
對這些有頂葉眼的物種，光也通過了頂葉眼。

63:38
and the sensors in that are responsive to blue and green,
裡面的傳感器對藍色和綠色有反應，

63:42
and also light through the skull,
而且光會穿過頭骨，

63:45
and I don't know if any of you have ever held up a leopard gecko to a bright light,
我不知道你們有沒有人曾經把豹紋守宮舉到明亮的光下，

63:48
you can see right through the head, you know, with the through the eyes, 
你可以直接用眼睛看穿頭部。

63:52
but when you think about these tiny animals,
當你想到這些小動物時，

63:54
you hold them up to the light, 
你把他們舉到光下，

63:55
and you can often see the organs through them, 
經常可以直接看到祂們的器官，

63:56
so the light's going right through the body of a small animal like that.
所以光線會直接穿過像那樣的小動物的身體。

63:59
so, it's not really surprising that they've made use of that by having cells inside the brain,
所以這並不奇怪，他們大腦內的細胞會使用光。
![](https://i.imgur.com/wrsuicE.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/KbNKZE2.png)

64:05
so if we just go inside his brain, here,
they are here's his brain。
所以如果我們進入他的大腦，這裡，
他們在這裡是他的大腦。
![](https://i.imgur.com/2XBDXpE.png)

64:09
here's just the brain and we've got the lateral eye, 
這只是大腦，我們有側眼，

64:11
we've got the third eye,
我們有第三隻眼，

64:14
and we've got underneath,
in the skull,
you've got the little third eye, 
在下面頭骨中，你有第三隻眼。

64:15 
and, you've got the pineal body, which is the area which produces all the hormones,
然後，你有鬆果體，這是產生所有激素的區域，

64:22
and you've got the "SCN", I can never say "supracrystomatic nuclei", 
你有 "SCN"。我永遠不會叫它 "超晶核"。

64:25
which is a little group of cells, which is the clocks, the clock setting mechanism in the brain.
這是一小群細胞，這是時鐘，大腦中的時鐘設置機制。

64:32
and you've got these tiny little photoreceptors,
lying in the ventricles of the brain,
你有這些微小的光感受器，
躺在腦室裡。

64:37
they're all responding to light.
他們都對光有反應。
![](https://i.imgur.com/kEBpKI5.png)

64:40
so the signals come from the light,
所以信號來自光，

64:41
and feed into the scn,
然後進入 SCN，

64:45
and then that feeds back a loop,
然後反饋一個循環，
![](https://i.imgur.com/BuaIW4p.png)

64:48
into the pineal, 
which is the main organ produced by producing the hormones and the neuro network, neuroendocrine network,
進入松果體，
它是產生激素和神經網絡、神經內分泌網絡的主要器官，
![](https://i.imgur.com/r557P7I.png)

64:56
so you've got an amazing system that's responding to the intensity of light, the wavelengths of light,
所以你有一個驚人的系統，它可以響應光的強度，光的波長，
 
65:04
and telling the brain what time of day it is, 
告訴大腦現在是什麼時間，

65:06
and how bright it is, 
and what season it is,
它是多麼明亮，
現在是什麼季節，

65:08
because how long the day length is,
因為白天的長度有多長，

65:12
and it's needs to be bright enough.
而且它需要足夠地亮。
![](https://i.imgur.com/FtAEG1k.png)

<!-- 光的強度 -->

65:14
the light that we give them needs to be bright enough to stimulate the brain in this way,
我們給他們的光需要足夠亮，以這種方式刺激大腦， 

65:19
when you think about it, 
if you put a dim light over it,
當你想到它時，
如果你在上面放一盞昏暗的燈，

65:21
there's not an awful lot going to get through the skull,
沒有太多東西要穿過頭骨，

65:22
whereas sunlight is incredibly bright and goes right through the skull,
而陽光非常明亮，直接穿過頭骨，

65:26
so we do have to also think about, the intensity that we're producing.
所以我們還必須考慮，我們生產的強度。

65:31
this is queen harris's little picture, which he puts up on the forums, it's absolutely wonderful.
這是哈里斯王后的小照片，他在論壇上發表的，絕對精彩。
![](https://i.imgur.com/Fuay2gX.jpg) 

65:36
he went outside with his camera, and took a photograph under an overcast sky,
他帶著相機走到外面，拍下了陰天下的照片
65:38
and also measured the lux, and he got 40000 lux.
還測量了 lux，他得到了 40000 lux。

65:44
he then didn't change the camera settings, he left them exactly the same,
然後他沒有換相機，
設置他讓他們完全一樣，

65:48
and he also measured the lux in his vivarium,
for his beardy and it was 4 000 lux.
他還測量了他的動物缸中的 lux，
他的鬍子是 4000 lux。

65:53
so that when he compared the photographs,
所以當他比較照片時，

65:55
he went oh my gosh, it's really dim in there,
然後他發現，我的天哪，裡面真的很暗，

65:57
:bearded_person: it looks like nighttime.
:bearded_person: 那看起來像晚上。

65:59
:older_woman: yeah, because our eyes immediately our pupils dilate, and we see it as bright.
:older_woman: 是的，因為我們的眼睛會立即放大瞳孔，我們看到它很亮。

66:06
if we walk into a dim room, and your eyes get used to it, you think it's bright. 
如果我們走進一個昏暗的房間，你的眼睛習慣了它，你就會認為它是明亮的。

66:10
and certainly, the beardy's eyes will do that as well,
當然，鬍子的眼睛也會這樣。

66:12
but his brain won't.
但他的大腦不會。

66:14
because his brain can't open up the way our pupils do, 
他的大腦無法像我們的瞳孔那樣打開，

66:16
so he sees that his brain sees that as really dim,
所以~~他看到~~他的大腦，認為那真的很暗，

66:19
and I think that's something, 
而我認為這是一件 "事"，

66:21
that we haven't really got to grips with yet.
我們還沒有真正掌握它。

66:23
in in our animal husbandry, we can increase the light quite a lot,
在我們的畜牧業中，我們可以增加很多光。

<!-- D3 -->
66:30
and then finally we go right down to the bottom,
