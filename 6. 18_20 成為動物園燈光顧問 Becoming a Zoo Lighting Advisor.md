Um but in June 2007,
嗯，但在 2007 年 6 月，

18:23
the curator at ZSL London Zoo, Richard Gibson,
倫敦動物園館長，理查德‧吉布森，

18:27
invited me to join the [BIAZA Reptile and Amphibian Working Group](https://biaza.org.uk/events/category/training),
邀請我加入 BIAZA 爬行動物和兩棲動物工作群。

18:33
we called it RAWG.

18:41
Well the following year they set up a UV focus group,
第二年他們成立了一個紫外線焦點小組，

18:44
and I was asked to be coordinator of the group.
我被要求成為小組的協調員。

18:47
And at first I was really daunted,
起初我真的很害怕，

18:49
because I was really new to the zoo world.

18:52
But they wanted us to create a guide, to the use of ub`?UV` with reptiles and amphibians in zoos.
但他們希望我們為動物園使用 UV 的爬行和兩棲動物建立一個指南。

18:58
And it was to be called a UV tool.

19:02
This UV tool, I discovered I had this remarkable team,

19:06
it was spread across 6 zoos and they were really supportive,

19:09
and they were keen to work on the products,

19:30
in America and in Jamaica and places like that.

19:43
they published it in 2010 and they encouraged us to adapt it for use in the UK zoos.

they're UV zones in honour of their inventor.
